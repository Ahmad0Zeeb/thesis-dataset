Amanda and Thea reported that, in 2018, ""the immigrant-native empoyment gap was 18 percentage points for women and 11 percentage points for men.""","Moreover, immigrant men and women face different challenges in the Swedish labour market. In 2018, the immigrant-native employment gap was 18 percentage points for women and 11 percentage points for men (Arbetsmarknadsrapport, 2019), implying that immigrant women might have a longer employment integration process.","The flow of people across international borders with the intention of settling in a new country is defined as international migration. International migration and the number of international migrants has had a steady growth over the last decades. However, the current pandemic, COVID-19, has affected all aspects in the global arena. With national borders closing, traveling rates decreasing and the overall insecure situation in the world, all forms of mobility have been disrupted. Yet, in 2020 there were still 281 million people who were living in a country that was not their country of origin. Today, about 3.6 percent of the world’s population are international migrants (United Nations, 2021). The share of people living in Sweden who were not born in Sweden amounted to 19.7 percent in 2020. This corresponds to approximately 2 million people. Also, the number of non-European immigrants has increased. In 2020, Syria and Iraq were the most common countries of origin among immigrants in Sweden (SCB, 2021). As immigrants, and especially refugees, are more likely to have lower income and be unemployed, one of the major political challenges in Sweden and in many other European countries has been that of employment integration of immigrants (e.g. Bevelander, 2011; Aldén and Hammarstedt, 2015; Rydgren, 2006; Arai and Vilhelmsson, 2004; Grand and Szulkin, 2002). The immigrant-native employment gap in Sweden is actually one of the largest among the OECD countries. This fact is troubling when considering the size of the foreign born population in Sweden (OECD/European Union, 2015). For this reason, it is imperative that we understand why the employment gap between immigrants and natives arises and what can be done to improve the labour market situation for immigrants. However, immigrants are not homogenous. Non-European immigrants have a lower employment rate and a higher share of unemployed than both natives and European immigrants (Aldén and Hammarstedt, 2015). Moreover, immigrant men and women face different challenges in the Swedish labour market. In 2018, the immigrant-native employment gap was 18 percentage points for women and 11 percentage points for men (Arbetsmarknadsrapport, 2019), implying that immigrant women might have a longer employment integration process. It has been shown that non-European immigrant women originating from African and Asian countries are particularly disadvantaged compared to non-European immigrant men and native women (Aldén and Hammarstedt, 2015). Factors such as education, labour market experience and language skills could explain why employment integration might differ between men and women. Another important factor that could explain why there is an immigrant-native employment gap and why it might differ by gender is discrimination. Especially non-European immigrant women might suffer from ethnic and gender discrimination in the labour market (Statskontoret, 2018). Since discrimination towards immigrants can be expressed through negative attitudes towards immigrants, overcoming these negative attitudes could improve the labour market situation of immigrants (Constant et al, 2009). Research has shown that individuals with negative attitudes towards immigrants often believe that immigrants will steal their jobs, increase crime rates and become an economic burden to society. However, the labour market situation of immigrants is not only affected by negative attitudes. Other possible obstacles are stereotypes and implicit prejudices. In Sweden, it has been found that Arab-Muslims are targets of negative implicit prejudices to a greater extent compared to natives (Agerström and Rooth, 2009). In light of what has been presented above, the aim of this paper is to examine whether there is a relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and the employment gap between non-European immigrants and natives in Sweden, and whether this relation differs by gender. In this way, we investigate if the immigrant-native employment gap can be partially explained by negative attitudes towards immigrants in Sweden. Based on this, we aim to answer the following research question: Is there a relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and non-European immigrants’ employment probabilities in Sweden and does the relation differ by gender? We look at the immigrant-native employment gap for men and women separately since previous studies have shown that immigrant men and women are disadvantaged and discriminated against to different degrees (e.g. Arai et al, 2016; Ek et al, 2020; Raijman and Semyonov, 1997). In order to answer this research question, we used individual data from the European Social Survey (ESS). We combined data from four different survey years (2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016) and estimated a linear probability model for the probability of being employed. To explore if there is a relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and the immigrant-native employment gap, we interacted an attitude measure with a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the individual is a non-European immigrant and 0 if the individual is born in Sweden. We estimated a regression for men and women separately to explore if the relation differs by gender. In this paper, the attitude measure stands for the share of individuals having negative attitudes towards immigrants in 14 different regions in Sweden. The respondents of the ESS were presented with the following statement: “Immigrants make [the] country [a] worse or better place to live”. This statement is used when constructing the attitude measure. This paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways. Firstly, this study investigates negative attitudes towards immigrants in Sweden as an explanation for the employment gap between non-European immigrants and natives in different regions in Sweden. Secondly, this study sheds light on whether negative attitudes towards immigrants affect the immigrant-native employment gap differently for men and women.",6031,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1571473/FULLTEXT01.pdf,TRUE,FALSE
Direct quotation,Large Source Text,TRUE,"Meysa and Hodan reported that ""the ability to support families through remittances has become a motivation for migration (Castles et al. 2013), but remittance flows are not directly related to migration flows but rather to the stock of migrants in a specific country.""","The money sent by migrants is called economic remittance and is mainly to provide for their families in another country. The ability to support families through remittances has become a motivation for migration (Castles et al. 2013), but remittance flows are not directly related to migration flows but rather to the stock of migrants in a specific country (Castles et al. 2013).","The most tangible link between migration and development is remittances. According to the World Bank’s latest Migration and Development Brief, remittances to low and middle-income countries reached a record high in 2018. Officially recorded annual remittance flows to low and middle-income countries have reached $529 billion in 2018, which is over the previous record high of $483 billion in 2017 (World Bank, 2019). Remittances are larger than the official development assistance received by low and middle-income countries (MPI, 2020). Recently, the World Bank (2020) has estimated that the amount of money migrants’ remit is expected to fall 14% by 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic where Europe and East Asia in 2020 and 2021 will undergo a high drop of remittance flows with 16% and 11%, and central Asia also suffering an 8% drop (World Bank, 2020). The money sent by migrants is called economic remittance and is mainly to provide for their families in another country. The ability to support families through remittances has become a motivation for migration (Castles et al. 2013), but remittance flows are not directly related to migration flows but rather to the stock of migrants in a specific country (Castles et al. 2013). Because migrant stocks have not declined the remittance levels have been maintained even when some migrants have lost their jobs, gotten wage cuts, and so on. The migrants are despite these factors willing to sacrifice a lot in order to provide for their families and communities in the homeland (Castles et al. 2013:252). Pelling (2014) in her book ''Det dolda biståndet?'' mentions that Swedes are not familiar with the word remittance and are not able to understand the meaning and importance of migrants’ connections with their home countries. Hence why Sweden lacks research about remittance. She also mentions that usually in Sweden the migrant is seen as “a victim in need of our support, rather than someone who himself mediates support to others."" (Pelling, 2014:9) Pelling (2014) explains that it often weighs heavily on migrants with consequences for integration and standard of living, that this topic should be discussed, problematized, and analyzed. Why migrants remit money has been receiving attention, yet researchers rarely draw attention to the topic of how migrants are affected by remittance in a Swedish context. Lucas and Stark (1985) discuss that undoubtedly some efforts to redirect most of the transfer payments for unreported are transactions through informal banking companies. The biggest obstacle to transferring money through more formal referral services is the cost of transfer and difficulties caused by banking rules in different countries. Lisa Pelling (2009) in her “Global utmaning” sub-report ''remitteringar från Sverige'' writes that remittances contribute to development and poverty reduction and that it is little known about remittances from Sweden. Swedish migrants who remit money make important contributions to their families and the development of their countries of origin. According to Pelling (2009), the migrants' efforts and sacrifices are invisible to non-migrants, and at the same time, the statistics available are not updated, no comprehensive scientific studies have been carried out yet. She argues that the Swedish government wants to increase the development effect of Swedish remittances, but the lack of statistics and research on remittances from Sweden makes it difficult to move forward. Without knowledge or current figures, it is utterly impossible to formulate an effective policy for migrants who remit. According to Omvärlden (2019) SCB (statistiska centralbyrån), a Swedish state administrative authority estimates that remittances from Sweden are 3 to 4 billion SEK per year, which is a lot lower amount compared to the 15 billion SEK reported by the World Bank in 2017. They write that remittances from Sweden are in the form of transfers in cash from migrants' and short-term employees' income. The reason for this is SCB's information is based on companies that mediate international payments, and they are less aware of cash gifts and transactions.",4198,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1532847/FULLTEXT01.pdf,TRUE,FALSE

Additionally, the study aims to identify the most efficient Java Collections and Sorting algorithms based on their energy consumption, CPU, and memory usage. The study employs controlled experiments that involve measuring the energy consumption, CPU, and memory usage of each Java Collection during the specified operations and Sorting algorithms. The conducted analysis for the outcomes of the controlled experiments provides direct answers to the research questions. These answers are anticipated to offer significant insights into the energy efficiency of Java Collections and Sorting algorithms, which could inform future software development strategies and contribute to the reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact in software development. The present research project is similar to the studies conducted by Hasan et al [11] and Pinto et al [12] in that both studies aim at scrutinizing and quantifying the energy consumption of Java Collections. According to Hasan et al, energy consumption for Java Lists, Maps, and Sets has been examined with regard to various operations, such as insertion, iteration, and random access, highlighting significant variations based on the type of operation. This research project shares similarities and differences with Hasan et al. Both studies involve examining and quantifying the energy consumption of Java Collections and investigating the energy consumption of varied operations. However, the differences between the two studies lie in the fact that Hasan et al explore the energy consumption of diverse operations with different scenarios, such as insertion at the beginning, middle, and end, whereas this project focuses on analyzing the energy consumption, CPU usage, and memory usage of various operations, specifically, insertion, searching, and deletion. Additionally, this project attempts to identify a statistical correlation between each Collection and quality attributes, such as CPU and memory usage. It is noteworthy that the findings of Hasan et al demonstrate that LinkedList has lower energy consumption than ArrayList when inserting elements at the start of a list, which aligns with the efficiency analysis results of the current research project in terms of energy consumption for the insertion operation. This concurrence suggests that LinkedList is a preferable option over ArrayList in terms of energy efficiency for inserting elements at the beginning of a list. The study conducted by Pinto et al investigates the energy efficiency of 16 commonly used Java Collections, categorized into lists, sets, and mappings, in different operations such as insertion, removal, and traversal on the Tomcat and Xalan systems. The study reveals that newer hash-table implementations can yield significant energy savings. It also finds that non-thread-safe implementations of data collections consume less energy than thread-safe ones and that energy consumption is influenced by different operations. Additionally, the study examines the impact of thread counts, initial capacities, and load factors on the energy consumption of map implementations in Java. The current research project shares similarities with Pinto et al's study in terms of examining energy consumption in Java collections. In contrast to the investigation by Pinto et al, this study scrutinizes the energy consumption of Java Collections on a singular device and concentrates on Collections that are embedded in the Java Collection framework, intended for performing insertion, search, and removal operations. Moreover, this study assesses the energy consumption associated with Collections in terms of their quality attributes and explores the statistical relationship between these attributes, and does not confine its focus solely to Java thread-safe Collections and does not extend its experiments to multiple systems, which distinguishes it from the study conducted by Pinto et al. Additionally, this research project is also similar to the study conducted by Alves et al. [3], which examined and analyzed the energy consumption of some Sorting algorithms. Alves's main investigation revealed that the Selection sort algorithm consumes the least energy, while the Bubble sort algorithm consumes the most energy. It is noteworthy that the findings of this research, as presented in Section 6.2.2, align with the observation that the Selection sort algorithm consumes a significant amount of energy when compared to the Bubble sort. However, Alves’s area of investigation focuses on three classic Sorting algorithms only and does not take into account any quality attributes while measuring energy consumption. In contrast, this study analyzed additional Sorting algorithms and their energy consumption in relation to some quality attributes, such as memory and CPU usage. Consequently, the findings suggest that the Bucket sort algorithm is the least efficient and worst Sorting algorithm. In conclusion, this paper has provided answers to the research questions presented in Section 1.3 and focuses on estimating the energy consumption, memory, and CPU usage of several Java Collections and Sorting algorithms. The study conducted controlled experiments and employed tools such as JoularJX to measure energy consumption, and RStudio to implement a statistical analysis using R to find out the relationship between energy consumption and quality attributes. Moreover, an efficiency analysis is conducted, and its findings are then represented using a 3D scatter plot to compare the mean values of energy consumption, CPU, and memory usage for each operation and algorithm. Regarding Java Collections, the examination reveals a complex landscape in terms of efficiency across various operations, such as Add, Contains, and Remove. It becomes evident that singling out a universally superior Collection(s) is an unattainable goal. Notably, LinkedList stands out for its exceptional energy efficiency during Add operations, but its performance falters significantly when it comes to Contains operations. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation considering the specific requirements and trade-offs of each operation is essential to determine the most suitable Collection(s) for a given context. Moreover, in addition operation, ArrayLists, ArrayDeque, and LinkedLists are recommended when memory, CPU, and energy consumption are all considered together. Notably, LinkedList is the optimal choice when only energy consumption is considered during addition. In terms of memory, CPU, and energy consumption, LinkedHashSet has the highest efficiency level when used for searching operations. If memory, CPU, and energy consumption are considered as a single unit, LinkedHashSet is the most efficient collection when used for removing. ArrayDeque, however, is the most energy-efficient choice for Java developers when it comes to the removal of data. Concerning Sorting algorithms, Quick sort, Heap sort, and Shell sort were identified as the most efficient in terms of energy consumption, CPU, and memory usage. Bucket sort was found to be less efficient due to its higher consumption and usage in all terms. This study has been conducted as the outcome of all those experiments' results and analyses covering effectively the research gap on which it is based. Additionally, the study highlights the need for developers to consider multiple factors when selecting a Collection or Sorting algorithm, emphasizing that there may be a lack of correlation between energy consumption and quality attributes (CPU and memory usage) in certain algorithms and Collections. The study also points out that time complexity does not always reflect efficiency in terms of energy consumption, CPU, and memory usage. Thus, the study underscores the importance of optimizing software for energy consumption, particularly in resource-constrained environments, and recommends using controlled experiments and appropriate methodologies to guide programmers in developing energy-efficient software programs which leads the software engineering field to be improved. Lastly, based on the findings of the conducted statistical analysis, it appears that there is a limited possibility of generalizing the correlation and relationship between energy consumption and CPU and memory usage across various Collection and Sorting algorithms in most cases. Specifically, the observed P-value is greater than 0.05, indicating that the results are not statistically significant. Therefore, further investigation is warranted as a part of future research endeavors to better understand this relationship.",8882,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1773090/FULLTEXT01.pdf,TRUE,TRUE

These results are implemented through the fact that foreign-named students received even lower test scores after the reform, thus we can say that the graders treated the foreign-named students positively.","As mentioned in our introduction section, there are is range of studies that investigate treatment effects against minority groups in different sectors. We focused on the schooling sector since grades are of major importance for future references and studys but also when entering the labour market. As Diamond and Persson showed that there are long-term consequences when considering earnings and the human capital. By using a difference-in-difference method on our obtained data from introductory macroeconomic sample, we are able to conclude that our results did not show any negative treatment effect against foreign-named students. These results are implemented through the fact that foreign-named students received even lower test scores after the reform, thus we can say that the graders treated the foreign-named students positively. When considering these results we can conclude that they show the opposite from previous similar studies conducted by Hinnerich, Höglin and Johannesson (2014), Sprietsma (2013), Botelho et al (2015) and (Van Ewijk, 2011). As mentioned in our introduction, discrimination is an interesting topic especially on a university level. Most universities have a diversified environment where students have different foreign backgrounds and also that it occurs a lot of exchange of students between countries. Furthermore we can conclude that the results deviate from the theory about Statistical discrimination and Becker’s theory about Taste-based discrimination due to the lack of negative treatment effects on foreign-named students. However an explanation could instead be due to the theory about “reversed-bias” by Behaghel et.al (2015). The positive treatment against foreign-named students could be due to a more compensating and a more lenient treatment for groups or minorities considered to be less privileged. This ‘’reversed-bias” can also be related to the fact that the macroeconomic exam was written in Swedish, thus this could imply that the graders overlooked the language and writing abilities and graded the foreign students in a more compliant way. In addition our second aim for this study was to investigate if there is a relationship between the graders gender and the treatment effect of the students. By extending our regression with a dummy for the graders gender, we conducted results showing that female graders treated foreign-named students more negatively compared tomale graders. The male graders showed results of a strong positive treatment effect against foreign-named students, but hence a negative treatment against Swedish named students. Moreover the female graders showed a positive treatment effect against Swedish-named students, and due to a slight decrease in test scores for foreign named students after the reform and fundamentally low test scores prior the reform therefore we came to our conclusion. These results however show the opposite compared to the study by Carlsson and Rooth (2007) where they found that male recruiters on the Swedish labour market tended to discriminate foreign applicants compared to female recruiters. Our explanations for these results can be related to the mechanism “in-group bias” where favoritism due to similar characteristics between the grader and the students could have had an impact. Thus this mechanism is beyond the scope of our paper, and we can therefore not conclusively say what factors contributed to these results considering the graders gender but this mechanism could be interesting to test in future studies. In the essence of our research questions we can conclude that there was no negative treatment effect against foreign-named students, and that female graders showed a more negativetreatment effect against foreign named students compared to the male graders.",3798,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1453705/FULLTEXT01.pdf,FALSE,TRUE

It continues with a restating the aim of the thesis and the findings arrived at. It concludes by suggesting areas where the thesis can be further expanded upon. There were some limitations in the research. First, we conducted a test which entails deploying a web application to three different cloud computing platforms. The goal was to monitor the uptime of the applications for at least a month and to compare these metrics with the uptime guaranteed by each cloud platform. While each of the three cloud service provider offers monthly connectivity uptime percentage, it would be better if we were able to run the test for a longer time, ideally, for a year, since uptime is usually calculated on a yearly basis. Also, due to limited computational resources, the applications were monitored at 5 minute intervals, which means a service interruption could have occurred and recovered from within the 5 minutes without us finding out. Second, we conducted a survey among cloud service providers in the Nordic region, regarding availability issues in cloud computing. The population of the respondents were very low. In fact, only 13% of the recipients answered the survey which did not give us much findings for the research. The goal of this thesis as previously in the aims and objectives was to investigate the threats to the availability of service in cloud computing and to provide some best practices that can be used to mitigate the threats. The motivation lies in the fact that availability is still a growing concern for organizations who already adopted cloud computing and one of the top reasons why other organizations are not adopting this technology. Primary and secondary materials were used in the thesis. Primary materials being survey and testing. The survey entails using questionnaires get the cloud service providers’ perspectives on availability issues in cloud computing. The testing entails a first-hand investigation of the service availability targets of three major cloud providers. Secondary materials derived from journals, articles, technical briefs, research papers, books and publications were used to formulate the initial findings in the theoretical part of the work. Sources such as news articles, security incident reports and press releases were used to investigate the current threats facing availability of cloud services. As a result, out of more than 40 cloud service outages and failures examined, 8 categories of threats were formulated. They include, in no particular order: power outage, hardware failure, cyber-attack, configuration error, software bug, human error, administrative or legal dispute, and network dependency. It goes without saying that cloud service providers can do more in terms of transparency about the cause of service failures and effective communication with customers during service disruptions. A number of techniques centering around redundancy, that can be used by cloud service providers to mitigate some of these threats, were proposed in section section 7.3. Similarly, customers of cloud service providers do not have to solely rely on providers to ensure constant availability, they can employ a number of techniques including, but not limited to, designing their applications to be fault tolerant and the use of multiple cloud providers. In addition, techniques that can be used by end users of cloud services to improve availability and ensure continuous access to their data in the cloud, were provided in section 7.4. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of availability or service failures is a prominent threat in cloud computing, and no cloud service provider is too big to fail. However, despite the challenges faced, many organizations are increasingly adopting cloud computing to maximize business returns. As mentioned in the limitations, the test conducted during the thesis could be run for a longer period of time, preferably, a year, since uptime is mostly calculated on a yearly basis. A robust monitoring tool can be built to monitor the applications, instead of the third party monitoring services employed in the test. In addition, the survey can be expanded to cloud service providers around the world and not only the ones in the Nordic region.",4313,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:646329/FULLTEXT01.pdf,TRUE,TRUE

However, the differences between the two studies lie in the fact that Hasan et al explore the energy consumption of diverse operations with different scenarios, such as insertion at the beginning, middle, and end, whereas this project focuses on analyzing the energy consumption, CPU usage, and memory usage of various operations, specifically, insertion, searching, and deletion. Additionally, this project attempts to identify a statistical correlation between each Collection and quality attributes, such as CPU and memory usage. It is noteworthy that the findings of Hasan et al demonstrate that LinkedList has lower energy consumption than ArrayList when inserting elements at the start of a list, which aligns with the efficiency analysis results of the current research project in terms of energy consumption for the insertion operation. This concurrence suggests that LinkedList is a preferable option over ArrayList in terms of energy efficiency for inserting elements at the beginning of a list. The study conducted by Pinto et al investigates the energy efficiency of 16 commonly used Java Collections, categorized into lists, sets, and mappings, in different operations such as insertion, removal, and traversal on the Tomcat and Xalan systems. The study reveals that newer hash-table implementations can yield significant energy savings. It also finds that non-thread-safe implementations of data collections consume less energy than thread-safe ones and that energy consumption is influenced by different operations. Additionally, the study examines the impact of thread counts, initial capacities, and load factors on the energy consumption of map implementations in Java. The current research project shares similarities with Pinto et al's study in terms of examining energy consumption in Java collections. In contrast to the investigation by Pinto et al, this study scrutinizes the energy consumption of Java Collections on a singular device and concentrates on Collections that are embedded in the Java Collection framework, intended for performing insertion, search, and removal operations. Moreover, this study assesses the energy consumption associated with Collections in terms of their quality attributes and explores the statistical relationship between these attributes, and does not confine its focus solely to Java thread-safe Collections and does not extend its experiments to multiple systems, which distinguishes it from the study conducted by Pinto et al. Additionally, this research project is also similar to the study conducted by Alves et al. [3], which examined and analyzed the energy consumption of some Sorting algorithms. Alves's main investigation revealed that the Selection sort algorithm consumes the least energy, while the Bubble sort algorithm consumes the most energy. It is noteworthy that the findings of this research, as presented in Section 6.2.2, align with the observation that the Selection sort algorithm consumes a significant amount of energy when compared to the Bubble sort. However, Alves’s area of investigation focuses on three classic Sorting algorithms only and does not take into account any quality attributes while measuring energy consumption. In contrast, this study analyzed additional Sorting algorithms and their energy consumption in relation to some quality attributes, such as memory and CPU usage. Consequently, the findings suggest that the Bucket sort algorithm is the least efficient and worst Sorting algorithm. In conclusion, this paper has provided answers to the research questions presented in Section 1.3 and focuses on estimating the energy consumption, memory, and CPU usage of several Java Collections and Sorting algorithms. The study conducted controlled experiments and employed tools such as JoularJX to measure energy consumption, and RStudio to implement a statistical analysis using R to find out the relationship between energy consumption and quality attributes. Moreover, an efficiency analysis is conducted, and its findings are then represented using a 3D scatter plot to compare the mean values of energy consumption, CPU, and memory usage for each operation and algorithm. Regarding Java Collections, the examination reveals a complex landscape in terms of efficiency across various operations, such as Add, Contains, and Remove. It becomes evident that singling out a universally superior Collection(s) is an unattainable goal. Notably, LinkedList stands out for its exceptional energy efficiency during Add operations, but its performance falters significantly when it comes to Contains operations. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation considering the specific requirements and trade-offs of each operation is essential to determine the most suitable Collection(s) for a given context. Moreover, in addition operation, ArrayLists, ArrayDeque, and LinkedLists are recommended when memory, CPU, and energy consumption are all considered together. Notably, LinkedList is the optimal choice when only energy consumption is considered during addition. In terms of memory, CPU, and energy consumption, LinkedHashSet has the highest efficiency level when used for searching operations. If memory, CPU, and energy consumption are considered as a single unit, LinkedHashSet is the most efficient collection when used for removing. ArrayDeque, however, is the most energy-efficient choice for Java developers when it comes to the removal of data. Concerning Sorting algorithms, Quick sort, Heap sort, and Shell sort were identified as the most efficient in terms of energy consumption, CPU, and memory usage. Bucket sort was found to be less efficient due to its higher consumption and usage in all terms. This study has been conducted as the outcome of all those experiments' results and analyses covering effectively the research gap on which it is based. Additionally, the study highlights the need for developers to consider multiple factors when selecting a Collection or Sorting algorithm, emphasizing that there may be a lack of correlation between energy consumption and quality attributes (CPU and memory usage) in certain algorithms and Collections. The study also points out that time complexity does not always reflect efficiency in terms of energy consumption, CPU, and memory usage. Thus, the study underscores the importance of optimizing software for energy consumption, particularly in resource-constrained environments, and recommends using controlled experiments and appropriate methodologies to guide programmers in developing energy-efficient software programs which leads the software engineering field to be improved. Lastly, based on the findings of the conducted statistical analysis, it appears that there is a limited possibility of generalizing the correlation and relationship between energy consumption and CPU and memory usage across various Collection and Sorting algorithms in most cases. Specifically, the observed P-value is greater than 0.05, indicating that the results are not statistically significant. Therefore, further investigation is warranted as a part of future research endeavors to better understand this relationship.",8883,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1773090/FULLTEXT01.pdf,TRUE,TRUE

Detecting historical remains protects cultural heritage from being destroyed by heavy ma- chinery performing routine maintenance in the woods. Applying ML-algorithms to that detection and survey will save costs and conserve the manpower of archaeology experts. The practical part of this thesis was performed at Softwerk AB in collaboration with the Archaeology Department of Linnaeus University and the Södra forest industry group. 1.1 Background Sweden is mostly covered by forests [1]. One of the issues in Swedish forestry is damaging historical remains when heavy machinery is used for scarification, soil preparation, and regeneration felling activities. In a recently held nationwide survey performed by The Swedish Forestry Agency (SKS), it was stated that 4 out of 10 cultural heritage sites in the forest were damaged by regeneration felling activities [2]. Moreover, serious damage was caused by soil scarification, forest machines, logging residue, and wind-felled trees [3]. The Register of Ancient Monuments (FMIS) in Sweden has a database of all the recorded ancient remains in the country [4]. Even though the database provides information of about 1.7 million items, it does not show a complete picture of all the historical remains to be found in Sweden [4]. It has been estimated by SKS that 75 % of all ancient remains in Sweden are located in the forest and that 75 % of the forest area is not fully surveyed [5]. Performing the surveys is expensive as fieldwork time is costly and requires archae- ology experts to be involved [6]. One type of historical remains to be found in Sweden is charcoal burner sites, known in Swedish as Kolbotten. These constitute the most common type of historical remains situated in the forest, which makes them also the most frequently damaged type [7]. The charcoal fuel industry has been vital for Swedish iron production from the Middle Ages all the way up to the 19th century, when blast furnaces and railroads came into use [7]. Despite the large number of charcoal-related historical remains, knowledge of Swedish charcoal production is still rather limited [7]. Charcoal burner sites were not systematically registered during two rounds of historical remains inventorying. Instead they were mostly transferred into FMIS from isolated sur- veys or forest history project’s records [7]. Therefore, identifying the locations of charcoal burner sites is crucial for their preservation and availability as an archaeological source [7]. The charcoal burner sites create an important link between scientific archeological research and local cultural history, which benefits the promotion of cultural heritage [7]. As long as maps, images, and other geographic information (geodata) of Swedish land- scape including LIDAR telemetry, are publicly available, [8] it seems possible to apply artificial intelligence (AI) to the information and create an algorithm for finding these historical remains. The existence of such an algorithm may benefit both Swedish forestry and Swedish cultural heritage. Attempts to locate different historical remains using AI have been made before. In 2016, scientists from the Norwegian Computer Center represented their approach to detecting charcoal kilns in Norway using Convolutional Neural Networks for feature extraction and then applying the features to ML classifiers. Their approach aimed to improve the previously used Semi-Automatic technique, which is based on pattern recognition. One limitation of their approach was the lack of the exact locations of the kilns. The reason for this limitation was the use of a linear classifier, which does not show an exact position but only says whether the kilns are present on an image. However, their approach showed high prediction accuracy, allowing for the detection of 84.5 % of the known kilns in the training dataset [9]. In 2020, a group of scientists also applied ML algorithms to LIDAR data in order to reveal ancient artifacts. They used LIDAR data images from the ancient city of Angamuco, Mexico, for which archaeologists visually identified and mapped local features. Those images were fed to deep-learning classifiers in order to train a labeling model. As the result, they trained more than 30 classifiers and showed promising accuracy figures. However, their approach required manual annotations of the objects. These annotations have been col- lected during several surveys by multiple archaeologists on the order of years [10]. Another group of scientists applied multitemporal ML to remote sensing big data for the detection of archaeological mounds in Pakistan. They used a classifier algorithm against a large-scale collection of synthetic-aperture radar and multi-spectral images, resulting in an accurate probability map for mound-like signatures. The results showed that the area contains many more archaeological mounds than previously found. To achieve their goals they used publicly available multi-spectral satellite images. Even though this information is publicly available for non-commercial use, the coverage of the data is poor while temporal and spatial resolution is limited [11]. Finally, a group of scientists from Slovakia used a dataset from the Pacunam LIDAR Initiative survey of the lowland Maya region in Guatemala to identify Mayan structures using ML models. They explored and compared two models, U-Net and Mask R-CNN, for semantic segmentation. In the study, they proved that a U-Net-based model performedbetter and was capable of correctly identifying 60–66% of all objects. To achieve these results, they also used manually labeled annotations made by archaeology experts, which can be considered as a limitation of their work since it requires the presence of archaeol- ogy experts to apply this approach to another domain [12]. This thesis is aimed mostly at data scientists and computer scientists studying machine learning, as well as at geologists, archaeologists, and other scientists interested in geodata analysis. It may also be of use to companies responsible for forest maintenance and representatives of government regulation agencies whose concerns lie in saving Swedish cultural heritage. Finding historical remains on LIDAR data is a tedious routine task yet it requires a certain level of knowledge in archaeology. As a result, markings of these objects in geoinformation systems (GIS) appear to be incomplete, and updating this information is expensive [6][4]. Related works show that computer vision leveraged by modern AI algorithms can detect historical remains using LIDAR data. However, there seems to be a knowledge gap on applying computer vision-based AI to different visual representations of LIDAR telemetry available for Sweden. Moreover, related studies use custom ML architectures and pay significant attention to either annotation and data preparations [10][12] or feature extraction [9]. If we could design a similar solution based on a publicly available, cutting-edge, off-the-shelf model trained on little, sparse, and biased data, and if that solution could take advantage of different types of available LIDAR visual representations, it would potentially help to reduce the costs of surveys and save Swedish historical remains from being destroyed by adding them to GIS and FMIS.",7474,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1567620/FULLTEXT01.pdf,TRUE,TRUE
Direct quotation,Large Source Text,TRUE,"Alhawi and Abdilrahim states that ""the software typically consists of a large number of classes, and a single change in a class might propagate to a significant percentage of other classes followed by an increase in faults/defects.""","The software typically consists of a large number of classes, and a single change in a class might propagate to a significant percentage of other classes followed by an increase in faults/defects. However, there is little or no evidence in practice that shows change-prone software modules or classes to be more fault-prone or vice versa.","Software systems evolve and change continuously over time. These changes could be to improve functionality, fix bugs, or add new features. Users’ requirements may change as well, causing further changes in the software artifacts and resulting in newer releases of the software [1]. At the same time, when users report a bug, a quick fix is essential, which also causes the software artifacts to change and evolve. Subsequently, frequent changes could introduce potential bugs, fixing of which causes more changes in the source artifacts. The software typically consists of a large number of classes, and a single change in a class might propagate to a significant percentage of other classes followed by an increase in faults/defects [2]. However, there is little or no evidence in practice that shows change-prone software modules or classes to be more fault-prone or vice versa. In this paper, we perform an empirical study that uses data collected from develop- ment history repositories and combined with data from issue-tracking systems of five different open-source software products. The goal is to assess whether classes that have an increased likelihood to change between any two given releases also have a higher like- lihood to be involved in faults/defects and vice versa. We also investigate the possible effect of class size on its change- and fault-proneness. The study relies on widely used software metrics, such as the number of changes, code churn, LOC, the number of bugs, and the defect density. Statistical evidence is presented to support the results and findings of this study. Change-proneness: In object-oriented systems, change-proneness is considered to be an essential external quality attribute because it signifies to what extent a class changes across the different versions of a system [1][2]. In this study, we used the following two metrics, to measure change-proneness: • Number of changes: the total number of times a class changed within a release. • Code churn: the total number of churns (lines added, deleted, and modified) that a class underwent within a release [3]. Fault-proneness: Another important external quality attribute in object-oriented systems. It can be defined as the possibility that a software artifact contains a fault/defect [3][4]. In this study, we used the following two metrics, to measure fault-proneness: • Number of bugs: the total number of faults/defects a class has within a release. • Defect Density: fault content per lines of code [5]. In this section, we discuss the relevant literature on investigating change-proneness, and fault-proneness in relation to software design practices and object-oriented software metrics. There is a myriad of previous research studying the impact of good and bad design practices on change- and fault-proneness. The study by Palma et al. [3] investigated the relationship between change-proneness and service patterns/anti-patterns. Our methodology was inspired by this study as we followed the same metrics extraction process, data mapping, and statistical analysis approach. The study found, among other results, that services involved in anti-patterns are more change-prone than others. The study by Jaafar et al. [6] evaluated the impact of design-pattern and anti-pattern dependencies on changes and faults, and one of its findings was that classes possessing dependencies with anti-patterns are more fault-prone. Khomh et al. [7] also investigated the impact of anti-patterns on the change- and fault-proneness of a class; the study found that classes involved in anti-patterns are more change- and fault-prone than others. The study also concludes that class size cannot explain the change-proneness of classes with anti-patterns. Finally, an empirical study by Guerrouj et al. [8] investigated the relationship between poor design practices (lexical smells) and change- and fault-proneness. It found that lexi- cal smells can make classes, involved in design smells, more fault-prone. This study also demonstrated that classes with design-smells only are more change- and fault-prone than those with lexical smells only. 1.2.2 Change- and Fault-proneness and Object-oriented Metrics Studies by Lu et al. [1] investigated the relationship between object-oriented metrics and change-proneness. Lu’s paper employed statistical techniques to examine the ability of 62 different OO metrics to predict change-proneness. The study revealed that size metrics exhibited moderate/almost moderate ability in differentiating change-prone classes from non-change prone ones; it also found that cohesion and coupling metrics are less able to predict change-proneness with inheritance metric being the poorest to predict it. Malhotra et al. [9] used software metrics to show that machine learning methods are comparable to the previously used logistics regression methods when it comes to predicting change-proneness; it also showed that testing based on change-proneness prediction leads to better quality as it allows developers to target the most change-prone classes. A paper by Singh et al. [10] also examined the ability of OO metrics to predict different levels of fault severity. The study showed that using machine learning methods to target classes with different severity levels of faults might help developers to better plan and test the fault-prone parts. Pai et al. [5] use Bayesian methods to analyse the fault -content and -proneness by relating the internal OO metrics of software to external quality metrics. Another research by Malhotra et al. [2] investigates the relationship between OO metrics and change-proneness using machine learning and statistical techniques. It also concludes that using these techniques to predict the change-proneness of classes in object-oriented systems is a better approach than regression techniques. Finally, the ability of complexity metrics to predict fault-prone classes in object-oriented systems was investigated by Zhou et al. [11]; it found that many metrics such as LOC, WMC, and AMC showed a moderate or almost moderate ability to predict fault- proneness. The study also concluded that LOC and WMC (weighted method McCabe complexity) are better indicators of fault-proneness.",6239,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1454014/FULLTEXT01.pdf,TRUE,TRUE

The chapter is rounded off with suggestions for further research that could supplement and broaden the knowledge about the study area further. The purpose of this study is to investigate, analyze, and gain an in-depth understanding of what motives migrants have that make them remit and how they are affected socially and economically by sending remittances from Sweden. A qualitative approach was taken, and eight semi-structured interviews with Swedish migrants with Iraqi and Somali backgrounds were conducted in order to collect data for analysis. The study resulted in the conclusion that most of the interviewees' motives were that they send remittances to family, and relatives because of altruism. Within the altruistic motives, the interviewees have been clear in explaining the receivers, for example, the family and relatives' circumstances in the home country, which means that they need financial support. We identified that some interviewees sent remittances and supported their parents in the home country to maintain favor in inheritance. Another reason we identified is tempered altruism or enlightened self-interest, that some interviewees remit with the intention of helping their family but also returning home, they invest in family and home. The interviewees informed us of their experience regarding the social and economic impact of sending remittances. They state that despite difficulties, they choose to continue to remit to their families in their origin country. The interviewees don’t see their social situation being impacted by sending remittances. Our interviewees’ production activity is that they can speak the language, work, pay taxes, follow laws, and hence they don’t see themselves as socially excluded from the majority of the society. We found that what mattered most to our interviewees was their social activity, they interact with mainstream society and identify with a cultural group in the host country. Their transnational ties are very important for them, and if they did not have them, they feel that they may have seen themselves socially excluded. However, they express how their economic situation is impacted by sending money to their families in the origin country. Almost all of our interviewees informed us how their saving activity is impacted by sending remittances and this indicates that they are socially excluded. The other economic factor that is impacted by remittances is the interviewees’ consumption, for example, they don’t have the resources for hobbies. The interviewees who remit too often did not choose to have an activity in their free time that required them to pay for it, because they thought that the family in the homeland would need the money. Since this research is not extensive enough to draw general conclusions, we can only say that some people can be impacted socially and economically by sending remittances, and there may be a larger social pattern. To find this out, a larger and more comprehensive study must be done with more respondents. As this study is not comprehensive enough to be able to draw a general conclusion about this, we can only state that it is prevalent for some individuals such as our interviewees. It can be said that our interviewees are in a state of limited economic, social and cultural resources and opportunities, because remittances limit their economy, so they cannot maintain a socially acceptable presence in Sweden according to Burchardt et al. (1999) social exclusion concept. Our interviewees don’t see their social situation as socially excluded from the majority of society, however, we have noticed that they didn’t have the opportunity to choose employment themselves to which they are trained. Our interviewees are trained in their homeland as civil engineers, but work as assistant nurses, psychologists as teachers, biomedical researchers as nurses, and pharmacists as opticians. Their choices and thereby opportunities being limited by the fact that they have to send money to their countries of origin and thus force them to prioritize work over education, and other barriers that arise when moving to another country and learning a new language. Our interviewees may be marginalized compared to the majority society and their social position may depend on other factors than their remittances, such as being a migrant. For Swedish society, it is important not to forget that our interviewees are migrants themselves not only live in relationships related to the Swedish context but also live in a network of transnational relationships, which have gone far beyond the borders of Sweden. The interviewees have expressed that they have better living standards than their families in the origin country. This is a comparison, where the migrants try to compare their living conditions and living standards with their families in the country of origin. Their situation depends on whom or with whom the migrant compares. People who compare themselves with Swedish measures may think they are socially excluded, while those who compare themselves with their country of origin may not see themselves as socially excluded at all, but quite the opposite. Our interviewees have fled from war-torn countries and if they try to compare their living conditions and standards with their families in the origin country then of course they will not see themselves as socially excluded. However, the interviewees have expressed several times how content they are with what they have and how they are helping and being an important person to their families and relatives. This study’s results are similar to previous research’s results and this was noticed during our interviews. The previous research was conducted in different countries, but their findings were somehow similar. Our results were no different, it showed that remittances impact Swedish migrants similarly. This study’s result contributes to the previous research, a result that is based on Swedish migrants, especially on the Iraqi and Somali communities. Something that we felt was missing in this study is a larger selection. We could have had a larger selection, but given the ongoing pandemic of Covid-19, the number of our interviewees were limited to only eight persons. The information our interviewees decided to share with us was sensitive, and therefore it was hard to find interviewees. We got turned down by one who did not have a residence permit and citizenship, and another acquaintance who did not feel comfortable sharing this type of information. We also noticed that in order to get this information, we had to ask private and sensitive questions, even though we got honest answers, we noticed the interviewees lowered their voices and took their time when they answered. In this study, we could have used less sensitive and personal questions, and in a way, we could have rephrased some questions. The majority of our respondents were our acquaintances and because we, the authors have migration backgrounds we were able to find interviewees. However, someone with another background might have a hard time findinginterviewees or they might find interviewees that shy away from the questions. The disadvantage of interviewing our acquaintances is that they didn’t want to elaborate on some answers as they think that we know about their situations. They were a little embarrassed to tell us about their financial situation, but because we knew them, we could fill in some of their information, and of course, we did it with their permission. The other interviewees that were not our acquaintances were also a bit shy to share their experience with us and since we don’t know their life as much as our acquaintances we interpreted and concluded their answers the way they have answered the questions. There was no way that we could prevent this because as mentioned earlier the pandemic and this phenomenon being a sensitive one has resulted in these consequences. Based on our study we have identified several phenomena in this remittances sender field that would require deeper research. Several interviewees mentioned how they have received remittances when they lived in the homeland. They have explained to us that sending remittances is something that generations pass to each other. Therefore, we suggest a study based on second-generation migrants’ experience with remittances if sending remittances is something generations pass to each other. Another suggestion is, as our interviewees mentioned, they are economically limited and that remittances are one of the factors resulting from this. Therefore, it will be interesting to study how the children of first-generation migrants have been impacted by their parents sending money to the origin country. It would also be interesting to study how Covid-19 has impacted remittances, especially the sender. Our interviewees have mentioned that they have struggled this year because of the pandemic, however, all of them have continued remitting in 2020. As mentioned earlier remittance is expected to fall 14% by 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It will be interesting to study how the senders plan their future remittances and their experience with the pandemic in relation to remittances.",9403,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1532847/FULLTEXT01.pdf,TRUE,TRUE

Therefore, further investigation is warranted as a part of future research endeavors to better understand this relationship.",8882,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1773090/FULLTEXT01.pdf,FALSE,FALSE

Especially non-European immigrant women might suffer from ethnic and gender discrimination in the labour market (Statskontoret, 2018). Since discrimination towards immigrants can be expressed through negative attitudes towards immigrants, overcoming these negative attitudes could improve the labour market situation of immigrants (Constant et al, 2009). ","The flow of people across international borders with the intention of settling in a new country is defined as international migration. International migration and the number of international migrants has had a steady growth over the last decades. However, the current pandemic, COVID-19, has affected all aspects in the global arena. With national borders closing, traveling rates decreasing and the overall insecure situation in the world, all forms of mobility have been disrupted. Yet, in 2020 there were still 281 million people who were living in a country that was not their country of origin. Today, about 3.6 percent of the world’s population are international migrants (United Nations, 2021). The share of people living in Sweden who were not born in Sweden amounted to 19.7 percent in 2020. This corresponds to approximately 2 million people. Also, the number of non-European immigrants has increased. In 2020, Syria and Iraq were the most common countries of origin among immigrants in Sweden (SCB, 2021). As immigrants, and especially refugees, are more likely to have lower income and be unemployed, one of the major political challenges in Sweden and in many other European countries has been that of employment integration of immigrants (e.g. Bevelander, 2011; Aldén and Hammarstedt, 2015; Rydgren, 2006; Arai and Vilhelmsson, 2004; Grand and Szulkin, 2002). The immigrant-native employment gap in Sweden is actually one of the largest among the OECD countries. This fact is troubling when considering the size of the foreign born population in Sweden (OECD/European Union, 2015). For this reason, it is imperative that we understand why the employment gap between immigrants and natives arises and what can be done to improve the labour market situation for immigrants. However, immigrants are not homogenous. Non-European immigrants have a lower employment rate and a higher share of unemployed than both natives and European immigrants (Aldén and Hammarstedt, 2015). Moreover, immigrant men and women face different challenges in the Swedish labour market. In 2018, the immigrant-native employment gap was 18 percentage points for women and 11 percentage points for men (Arbetsmarknadsrapport, 2019), implying that immigrant women might have a longer employment integration process. It has been shown that non-European immigrant women originating from African and Asian countries are particularly disadvantaged compared to non-European immigrant men and native women (Aldén and Hammarstedt, 2015). Factors such as education, labour market experience and language skills could explain why employment integration might differ between men and women.5 Another important factor that could explain why there is an immigrant-native employment gap and why it might differ by gender is discrimination. Especially non-European immigrant women might suffer from ethnic and gender discrimination in the labour market (Statskontoret, 2018). Since discrimination towards immigrants can be expressed through negative attitudes towards immigrants, overcoming these negative attitudes could improve the labour market situation of immigrants (Constant et al, 2009). Research has shown that individuals with negative attitudes towards immigrants often believe that immigrants will steal their jobs, increase crime rates and become an economic burden to society. However, the labour market situation of immigrants is not only affected by negative attitudes. Other possible obstacles are stereotypes and implicit prejudices. In Sweden, it has been found that Arab-Muslims are targets of negative implicit prejudices to a greater extent compared to natives (Agerström and Rooth, 2009). In light of what has been presented above, the aim of this paper is to examine whether there is a relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and the employment gap between non-European immigrants and natives in Sweden, and whether this relation differs by gender. In this way, we investigate if the immigrant-native employment gap can be partially explained by negative attitudes towards immigrants in Sweden. Based on this, we aim to answer the following research question: Is there a relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and non-European immigrants’ employment probabilities in Sweden and does the relation differ by gender? We look at the immigrant-native employment gap for men and women separately since previous studies have shown that immigrant men and women are disadvantaged and discriminated against to different degrees (e.g. Arai et al, 2016; Ek et al, 2020; Raijman and Semyonov, 1997). In order to answer this research question, we used individual data from the European Social Survey (ESS). We combined data from four different survey years (2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016) and estimated a linear probability model for the probability of being employed. To explore if there is a relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and the immigrant native employment gap, we interacted an attitude measure with a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the individual is a non-European immigrant and 0 if the individual is born in Sweden. We estimated a regression for men and women separately to explore if the relation differs by gender. In this paper, the attitude measure stands for the share of individuals having negative attitudes towards immigrants in 14 different regions in Sweden.6 were presented with the following statement: “Immigrants make [the] country [a] worse or better place to live”. This statement is used when constructing the attitude measure. This paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways. Firstly, this study investigates negative attitudes towards immigrants in Sweden as an explanation for the employment gap between non-European immigrants and natives in different regions in Sweden. Secondly, this study sheds light on whether negative attitudes towards immigrants affect the immigrant-native employment gap differently for men and women. The remaining of this paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical framework for the paper. Section 3 presents a review of relevant previous literature. Section 4 presents the data used in the paper and descriptive statistics of the data. Section 5 presents the methodological framework for the paper. Section 6 presents the results.

These results are implemented through the fact that foreign-named students received even lower test scores after the reform, thus we can say that the graders treated the foreign-named students positively.","As mentioned in our introduction section, there are is range of studies that investigate treatment effects against minority groups in different sectors. We focused on the schooling sector since grades are of major importance for future references and studys but also when entering the labour market. As Diamond and Persson showed that there are long-term consequences when considering earnings and the human capital. By using a difference-in-difference method on our obtained data from introductory macroeconomic sample, we are able to conclude that our results did not show any negative treatment effect against foreign-named students. These results are implemented through the fact that foreign-named students received even lower test scores after the reform, thus we can say that the graders treated the foreign-named students positively. When considering these results we can conclude that they show the opposite from previous similar studies conducted by Hinnerich, Höglin and Johannesson (2014), Sprietsma (2013), Botelho et al (2015) and (Van Ewijk, 2011). As mentioned in our introduction, discrimination is an interesting topic especially on a university level. Most universities have a diversified environment where students have different foreign backgrounds and also that it occurs a lot of exchange of students between countries. Furthermore we can conclude that the results deviate from the theory about Statistical discrimination and Becker’s theory about Taste-based discrimination due to the lack of negative treatment effects on foreign-named students. However an explanation could instead be due to the theory about “reversed-bias” by Behaghel et.al (2015). The positive treatment against foreign-named students could be due to a more compensating and a more lenient treatment for groups or minorities considered to be less privileged. This ‘’reversed-bias” can also be related to the fact that the macroeconomic exam was written in Swedish, thus this could imply that the graders overlooked the language and writing abilities and graded the foreign students in a more compliant way. In addition our second aim for this study was to investigate if there is a relationship between the graders gender and the treatment effect of the students. By extending our regression with a dummy for the graders gender, we conducted results showing that female graders treated foreign-named students more negatively compared tomale graders. The male graders showed results of a strong positive treatment effect against foreign-named students, but hence a negative treatment against Swedish named students. Moreover the female graders showed a positive treatment effect against Swedish-named students, and due to a slight decrease in test scores for foreign named students after the reform and fundamentally low test scores prior the reform therefore we came to our conclusion. These results however show the opposite compared to the study by Carlsson and Rooth (2007) where they found that male recruiters on the Swedish labour market tended to discriminate foreign applicants compared to female recruiters. Our explanations for these results can be related to the mechanism “in-group bias” where favoritism due to similar characteristics between the grader and the students could have had an impact. Thus this mechanism is beyond the scope of our paper, and we can therefore not conclusively say what factors contributed to these results considering the graders gender but this mechanism could be interesting to test in future studies. In the essence of our research questions we can conclude that there was no negative treatment effect against foreign-named students, and that female graders showed a more negativetreatment effect against foreign named students compared to the male graders.",3798,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1453705/FULLTEXT01.pdf,FALSE,FALSE

It continues with a restating the aim of the thesis and the findings arrived at. It concludes by suggesting areas where the thesis can be further expanded upon. There were some limitations in the research. First, we conducted a test which entails deploying a web application to three different cloud computing platforms. The goal was to monitor the uptime of the applications for at least a month and to compare these metrics with the uptime guaranteed by each cloud platform. While each of the three cloud service provider offers monthly connectivity uptime percentage, it would be better if we were able to run the test for a longer time, ideally, for a year, since uptime is usually calculated on a yearly basis. Also, due to limited computational resources, the applications were monitored at 5 minute intervals, which means a service interruption could have occurred and recovered from within the 5 minutes without us finding out. Second, we conducted a survey among cloud service providers in the Nordic region, regarding availability issues in cloud computing. The population of the respondents were very low. In fact, only 13% of the recipients answered the survey which did not give us much findings for the research. The goal of this thesis as previously in the aims and objectives was to investigate the threats to the availability of service in cloud computing and to provide some best practices that can be used to mitigate the threats. The motivation lies in the fact that availability is still a growing concern for organizations who already adopted cloud computing and one of the top reasons why other organizations are not adopting this technology. Primary and secondary materials were used in the thesis. Primary materials being survey and testing. The survey entails using questionnaires get the cloud service providers’ perspectives on availability issues in cloud computing. The testing entails a first-hand investigation of the service availability targets of three major cloud providers. Secondary materials derived from journals, articles, technical briefs, research papers, books and publications were used to formulate the initial findings in the theoretical part of the work. Sources such as news articles, security incident reports and press releases were used to investigate the current threats facing availability of cloud services. As a result, out of more than 40 cloud service outages and failures examined, 8 categories of threats were formulated. They include, in no particular order: power outage, hardware failure, cyber-attack, configuration error, software bug, human error, administrative or legal dispute, and network dependency. It goes without saying that cloud service providers can do more in terms of transparency about the cause of service failures and effective communication with customers during service disruptions. A number of techniques centering around redundancy, that can be used by cloud service providers to mitigate some of these threats, were proposed in section section 7.3. Similarly, customers of cloud service providers do not have to solely rely on providers to ensure constant availability, they can employ a number of techniques including, but not limited to, designing their applications to be fault tolerant and the use of multiple cloud providers. In addition, techniques that can be used by end users of cloud services to improve availability and ensure continuous access to their data in the cloud, were provided in section 7.4. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of availability or service failures is a prominent threat in cloud computing, and no cloud service provider is too big to fail. However, despite the challenges faced, many organizations are increasingly adopting cloud computing to maximize business returns. As mentioned in the limitations, the test conducted during the thesis could be run for a longer period of time, preferably, a year, since uptime is mostly calculated on a yearly basis. A robust monitoring tool can be built to monitor the applications, instead of the third party monitoring services employed in the test. In addition, the survey can be expanded to cloud service providers around the world and not only the ones in the Nordic region.",4313,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:646329/FULLTEXT01.pdf,FALSE,FALSE

Notably, LinkedList is the optimal choice when only energy consumption is considered during addition."," The goal of this study is to determine the potential relationship, if any, between energy consumption and commonly performed operations on Java Collections - including addition, search, and removal of elements, as well as widely used Sorting algorithms in Java programming. Additionally, the study aims to identify the most efficient Java Collections and Sorting algorithms based on their energy consumption, CPU, and memory usage. The study employs controlled experiments that involve measuring the energy consumption, CPU, and memory usage of each Java Collection during the specified operations and Sorting algorithms. The conducted analysis for the outcomes of the controlled experiments provides direct answers to the research questions. These answers are anticipated to offer significant insights into the energy efficiency of Java Collections and Sorting algorithms, which could inform future software development strategies and contribute to the reduction of energy consumption and environmental impact in software development. The present research project is similar to the studies conducted by Hasan et al [11] and Pinto et al [12] in that both studies aim at scrutinizing and quantifying the energy consumption of Java Collections. According to Hasan et al, energy consumption for Java Lists, Maps, and Sets has been examined with regard to various operations, such as insertion, iteration, and random access, highlighting significant variations based on the type of operation. This research project shares similarities and differences with Hasan et al. Both studies involve examining and quantifying the energy consumption of Java Collections and investigating the energy consumption of varied operations. However, the differences between the two studies lie in the fact that Hasan et al explore the energy consumption of diverse operations with different scenarios, such as insertion at the beginning, middle, and end, whereas this project focuses on analyzing the energy consumption, CPU usage, and memory usage of various operations, specifically, insertion, searching, and deletion. Additionally, this project attempts to identify a statistical correlation between each Collection and quality attributes, such as CPU and memory usage. It is noteworthy that the findings of Hasan et al demonstrate that LinkedList has lower energy consumption than ArrayList when inserting elements at the start of a list, which aligns with the efficiency analysis results of the current research project in terms of energy consumption for the insertion operation. This concurrence suggests that LinkedList is a preferable option over ArrayList in terms of energy efficiency for inserting elements at the beginning of a list. The study conducted by Pinto et al investigates the energy efficiency of 16 commonly used Java Collections, categorized into lists, sets, and mappings, in different operations such as insertion, removal, and traversal on the Tomcat and Xalan systems. The study reveals that newer hash-table implementations can yield significant energy savings. It also finds that non-thread-safe implementations of data collections consume less energy than thread-safe ones and that energy consumption is influenced by different operations. Additionally, the study examines the impact of thread counts, initial capacities, and load factors on the energy consumption of map implementations in Java. The current research project shares similarities with Pinto et al's study in terms of examining energy consumption in Java collections. In contrast to the investigation by Pinto et al, this study scrutinizes the energy consumption of Java Collections on a singular device and concentrates on Collections that are embedded in the Java Collection framework, intended for performing insertion, search, and removal operations. Moreover, this study assesses the energy consumption associated with Collections in terms of their quality attributes and explores the statistical relationship between these attributes, and does not confine its focus solely to Java thread-safe Collections and does not extend its experiments to multiple systems, which distinguishes it from the study conducted by Pinto et al. Additionally, this research project is also similar to the study conducted by Alves et al. [3], which examined and analyzed the energy consumption of some Sorting algorithms. Alves's main investigation revealed that the Selection sort algorithm consumes the least energy, while the Bubble sort algorithm consumes the most energy. It is noteworthy that the findings of this research, as presented in Section 6.2.2, align with the observation that the Selection sort algorithm consumes a significant amount of energy when compared to the Bubble sort. However, Alves’s area of investigation focuses on three classic Sorting algorithms only and does not take into account any quality attributes while measuring energy consumption. In contrast, this study analyzed additional Sorting algorithms and their energy consumption in relation to some quality attributes, such as memory and CPU usage. Consequently, the findings suggest that the Bucket sort algorithm is the least efficient and worst Sorting algorithm. In conclusion, this paper has provided answers to the research questions presented in Section 1.3 and focuses on estimating the energy consumption, memory, and CPU usage of several Java Collections and Sorting algorithms. The study conducted controlled experiments and employed tools such as JoularJX to measure energy consumption, and RStudio to implement a statistical analysis using R to find out the relationship between energy consumption and quality attributes. Moreover, an efficiency analysis is conducted, and its findings are then represented using a 3D scatter plot to compare the mean values of energy consumption, CPU, and memory usage for each operation and algorithm. Regarding Java Collections, the examination reveals a complex landscape in terms of efficiency across various operations, such as Add, Contains, and Remove. It becomes evident that singling out a universally superior Collection(s) is an unattainable goal. Notably, LinkedList stands out for its exceptional energy efficiency during Add operations, but its performance falters significantly when it comes to Contains operations. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation considering the specific requirements and trade-offs of each operation is essential to determine the most suitable Collection(s) for a given context. Moreover, in addition operation, ArrayLists, ArrayDeque, and LinkedLists are recommended when memory, CPU, and energy consumption are all considered together. Notably, LinkedList is the optimal choice when only energy consumption is considered during addition. In terms of memory, CPU, and energy consumption, LinkedHashSet has the highest efficiency level when used for searching operations. If memory, CPU, and energy consumption are considered as a single unit, LinkedHashSet is the most efficient collection when used for removing. ArrayDeque, however, is the most energy-efficient choice for Java developers when it comes to the removal of data. Concerning Sorting algorithms, Quick sort, Heap sort, and Shell sort were identified as the most efficient in terms of energy consumption, CPU, and memory usage. Bucket sort was found to be less efficient due to its higher consumption and usage in all terms. This study has been conducted as the outcome of all those experiments' results and analyses covering effectively the research gap on which it is based. Additionally, the study highlights the need for developers to consider multiple factors when selecting a Collection or Sorting algorithm, emphasizing that there may be a lack of correlation between energy consumption and quality attributes (CPU and memory usage) in certain algorithms and Collections. The study also points out that time complexity does not always reflect efficiency in terms of energy consumption, CPU, and memory usage. Thus, the study underscores the importance of optimizing software for energy consumption, particularly in resource-constrained environments, and recommends using controlled experiments and appropriate methodologies to guide programmers in developing energy-efficient software programs which leads the software engineering field to be improved. Lastly, based on the findings of the conducted statistical analysis, it appears that there is a limited possibility of generalizing the correlation and relationship between energy consumption and CPU and memory usage across various Collection and Sorting algorithms in most cases. Specifically, the observed P-value is greater than 0.05, indicating that the results are not statistically significant. Therefore, further investigation is warranted as a part of future research endeavors to better understand this relationship.",8883,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1773090/FULLTEXT01.pdf,FALSE,FALSE

Detecting historical remains protects cultural heritage from being destroyed by heavy ma- chinery performing routine maintenance in the woods. Applying ML-algorithms to that detection and survey will save costs and conserve the manpower of archaeology experts. The practical part of this thesis was performed at Softwerk AB in collaboration with the Archaeology Department of Linnaeus University and the Södra forest industry group. 1.1 Background Sweden is mostly covered by forests [1]. One of the issues in Swedish forestry is damaging historical remains when heavy machinery is used for scarification, soil preparation, and regeneration felling activities. In a recently held nationwide survey performed by The Swedish Forestry Agency (SKS), it was stated that 4 out of 10 cultural heritage sites in the forest were damaged by regeneration felling activities [2]. Moreover, serious damage was caused by soil scarification, forest machines, logging residue, and wind-felled trees [3]. The Register of Ancient Monuments (FMIS) in Sweden has a database of all the recorded ancient remains in the country [4]. Even though the database provides information of about 1.7 million items, it does not show a complete picture of all the historical remains to be found in Sweden [4]. It has been estimated by SKS that 75 % of all ancient remains in Sweden are located in the forest and that 75 % of the forest area is not fully surveyed [5]. Performing the surveys is expensive as fieldwork time is costly and requires archae- ology experts to be involved [6]. One type of historical remains to be found in Sweden is charcoal burner sites, known in Swedish as Kolbotten. These constitute the most common type of historical remains situated in the forest, which makes them also the most frequently damaged type [7]. The charcoal fuel industry has been vital for Swedish iron production from the Middle Ages all the way up to the 19th century, when blast furnaces and railroads came into use [7]. Despite the large number of charcoal-related historical remains, knowledge of Swedish charcoal production is still rather limited [7]. Charcoal burner sites were not systematically registered during two rounds of historical remains inventorying. Instead they were mostly transferred into FMIS from isolated sur- veys or forest history project’s records [7]. Therefore, identifying the locations of charcoal burner sites is crucial for their preservation and availability as an archaeological source [7]. The charcoal burner sites create an important link between scientific archeological research and local cultural history, which benefits the promotion of cultural heritage [7]. As long as maps, images, and other geographic information (geodata) of Swedish land- scape including LIDAR telemetry, are publicly available, [8] it seems possible to apply artificial intelligence (AI) to the information and create an algorithm for finding these historical remains. The existence of such an algorithm may benefit both Swedish forestry and Swedish cultural heritage. Attempts to locate different historical remains using AI have been made before. In 2016, scientists from the Norwegian Computer Center represented their approach to detecting charcoal kilns in Norway using Convolutional Neural Networks for feature extraction and then applying the features to ML classifiers. Their approach aimed to improve the previously used Semi-Automatic technique, which is based on pattern recognition. One limitation of their approach was the lack of the exact locations of the kilns. The reason for this limitation was the use of a linear classifier, which does not show an exact position but only says whether the kilns are present on an image. However, their approach showed high prediction accuracy, allowing for the detection of 84.5 % of the known kilns in the training dataset [9]. In 2020, a group of scientists also applied ML algorithms to LIDAR data in order to reveal ancient artifacts. They used LIDAR data images from the ancient city of Angamuco, Mexico, for which archaeologists visually identified and mapped local features. Those images were fed to deep-learning classifiers in order to train a labeling model. As the result, they trained more than 30 classifiers and showed promising accuracy figures. However, their approach required manual annotations of the objects. These annotations have been col- lected during several surveys by multiple archaeologists on the order of years [10]. Another group of scientists applied multitemporal ML to remote sensing big data for the detection of archaeological mounds in Pakistan. They used a classifier algorithm against a large-scale collection of synthetic-aperture radar and multi-spectral images, resulting in an accurate probability map for mound-like signatures. The results showed that the area contains many more archaeological mounds than previously found. To achieve their goals they used publicly available multi-spectral satellite images. Even though this information is publicly available for non-commercial use, the coverage of the data is poor while temporal and spatial resolution is limited [11]. Finally, a group of scientists from Slovakia used a dataset from the Pacunam LIDAR Initiative survey of the lowland Maya region in Guatemala to identify Mayan structures using ML models. They explored and compared two models, U-Net and Mask R-CNN, for semantic segmentation. In the study, they proved that a U-Net-based model performedbetter and was capable of correctly identifying 60–66% of all objects. To achieve these results, they also used manually labeled annotations made by archaeology experts, which can be considered as a limitation of their work since it requires the presence of archaeol- ogy experts to apply this approach to another domain [12]. This thesis is aimed mostly at data scientists and computer scientists studying machine learning, as well as at geologists, archaeologists, and other scientists interested in geodata analysis. It may also be of use to companies responsible for forest maintenance and representatives of government regulation agencies whose concerns lie in saving Swedish cultural heritage. Finding historical remains on LIDAR data is a tedious routine task yet it requires a certain level of knowledge in archaeology. As a result, markings of these objects in geoinformation systems (GIS) appear to be incomplete, and updating this information is expensive [6][4]. Related works show that computer vision leveraged by modern AI algorithms can detect historical remains using LIDAR data. However, there seems to be a knowledge gap on applying computer vision-based AI to different visual representations of LIDAR telemetry available for Sweden. Moreover, related studies use custom ML architectures and pay significant attention to either annotation and data preparations [10][12] or feature extraction [9]. If we could design a similar solution based on a publicly available, cutting-edge, off-the-shelf model trained on little, sparse, and biased data, and if that solution could take advantage of different types of available LIDAR visual representations, it would potentially help to reduce the costs of surveys and save Swedish historical remains from being destroyed by adding them to GIS and FMIS.",7474,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1567620/FULLTEXT01.pdf,FALSE,FALSE

The ability to support families through remittances has become a motivation for migration (Castles et al. 2013), but remittance flows are not directly related to migration flows but rather to the stock of migrants in a specific country (Castles et al. 2013).","1. Introduction The most tangible link between migration and development is remittances. According to the World Bank’s latest Migration and Development Brief, remittances to low and middle-income countries reached a record high in 2018. Officially recorded annual remittance flows to low and middle-income countries have reached $529 billion in 2018, which is over the previous record high of $483 billion in 2017 (World Bank, 2019). Remittances are larger than the official development assistance received by low and middle-income countries (MPI, 2020). Recently, the World Bank (2020) has estimated that the amount of money migrants’ remit is expected to fall 14% by 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic where Europe and East Asia in 2020 and 2021 will undergo a high drop of remittance flows with 16% and 11%, and central Asia also suffering an 8% drop (World Bank, 2020). The money sent by migrants is called economic remittance and is mainly to provide for their families in another country. The ability to support families through remittances has become a motivation for migration (Castles et al. 2013), but remittance flows are not directly related to migration flows but rather to the stock of migrants in a specific country (Castles et al. 2013). Because migrant stocks have not declined the remittance levels have been maintained even when some migrants have lost their jobs, gotten wage cuts, and so on. The migrants are despite these factors willing to sacrifice a lot in order to provide for their families and communities in the homeland (Castles et al. 2013:252). Pelling (2014) in her book ''Det dolda biståndet?'' mentions that Swedes are not familiar with the word remittance and are not able to understand the meaning and importance of migrants’ connections with their home countries. Hence why Sweden lacks research about remittance. She also mentions that usually in Sweden the migrant is seen as “a victim in need of our support, rather than someone who himself mediates support to others."" (Pelling, 2014:9) Pelling (2014) explains that it often weighs heavily on migrants with consequences for integration and standard of living, that this topic should be discussed, problematized, and analyzed. 1.1 Background Why migrants remit money has been receiving attention, yet researchers rarely draw attention to the topic of how migrants are affected by remittance in a Swedish context. Lucas and Stark (1985) discuss that undoubtedly some efforts to redirect most of the transfer payments for unreported are transactions through informal banking companies. The biggest obstacle to transferring money through more formal referral services is the cost of transfer and difficulties caused by banking rules in different countries. Lisa Pelling (2009) in her “Global utmaning” sub-report ''remitteringar från Sverige'' writes that remittances contribute to development and poverty reduction and that it is little known about remittances from Sweden. Swedish migrants who remit money make important contributions to their families and the development of their countries of origin. According to Pelling (2009), the migrants' efforts and sacrifices are invisible to non-migrants, and at the same time, the statistics available are not updated, no comprehensive scientific studies have been carried out yet. She argues that the Swedish government wants to increase the development effect of Swedish remittances, but the lack of statistics and research on remittances from Sweden makes it difficult to move forward. Without knowledge or current figures, it is utterly impossible to formulate an effective policy for migrants who remit. According to Omvärlden (2019) SCB (statistiska centralbyrån), a Swedish state administrative authority estimates that remittances from Sweden are 3 to 4 billion SEK per year, which is a lot lower amount compared to the 15 billion SEK reported by the World Bank in 2017. They write that remittances from Sweden are in the form of transfers in cash from migrants' and short-term employees' income. The reason for this is SCB's information is based on companies that mediate international payments, and they are less aware of cash gifts and transactions.",4198,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1532847/FULLTEXT01.pdf,FALSE,FALSE
Direct quotation,Wrong Information and Long Source Text,FALSE,"Alhawi and Abdilrahim states that ""the software typically consists of a small number of classes, and a single change in a class might propagate to a significant percentage of other classes followed by an increase in faults/defects.""","The software typically consists of a large number of classes, and a single change in a class might propagate to a significant percentage of other classes followed by an increase in faults/defects. However, there is little or no evidence in practice that shows change-prone software modules or classes to be more fault-prone or vice versa.","Software systems evolve and change continuously over time. These changes could be to improve functionality, fix bugs, or add new features. Users’ requirements may change as well, causing further changes in the software artifacts and resulting in newer releases of the software [1]. At the same time, when users report a bug, a quick fix is essential, which also causes the software artifacts to change and evolve. Subsequently, frequent changes could introduce potential bugs, fixing of which causes more changes in the source artifacts. The software typically consists of a large number of classes, and a single change in a class might propagate to a significant percentage of other classes followed by an increase in faults/defects [2]. However, there is little or no evidence in practice that shows change-prone software modules or classes to be more fault-prone or vice versa. In this paper, we perform an empirical study that uses data collected from develop- ment history repositories and combined with data from issue-tracking systems of five different open-source software products. The goal is to assess whether classes that have an increased likelihood to change between any two given releases also have a higher like- lihood to be involved in faults/defects and vice versa. We also investigate the possible effect of class size on its change- and fault-proneness. The study relies on widely used software metrics, such as the number of changes, code churn, LOC, the number of bugs, and the defect density. Statistical evidence is presented to support the results and findings of this study. Change-proneness: In object-oriented systems, change-proneness is considered to be an essential external quality attribute because it signifies to what extent a class changes across the different versions of a system [1][2]. In this study, we used the following two metrics, to measure change-proneness: • Number of changes: the total number of times a class changed within a release. • Code churn: the total number of churns (lines added, deleted, and modified) that a class underwent within a release [3]. Fault-proneness: Another important external quality attribute in object-oriented systems. It can be defined as the possibility that a software artifact contains a fault/defect [3][4]. In this study, we used the following two metrics, to measure fault-proneness: • Number of bugs: the total number of faults/defects a class has within a release. • Defect Density: fault content per lines of code [5]. In this section, we discuss the relevant literature on investigating change-proneness, and fault-proneness in relation to software design practices and object-oriented software metrics. There is a myriad of previous research studying the impact of good and bad design practices on change- and fault-proneness. The study by Palma et al. [3] investigated the relationship between change-proneness and service patterns/anti-patterns. Our methodology was inspired by this study as we followed the same metrics extraction process, data mapping, and statistical analysis approach. The study found, among other results, that services involved in anti-patterns are more change-prone than others. The study by Jaafar et al. [6] evaluated the impact of design-pattern and anti-pattern dependencies on changes and faults, and one of its findings was that classes possessing dependencies with anti-patterns are more fault-prone. Khomh et al. [7] also investigated the impact of anti-patterns on the change- and fault-proneness of a class; the study found that classes involved in anti-patterns are more change- and fault-prone than others. The study also concludes that class size cannot explain the change-proneness of classes with anti-patterns. Finally, an empirical study by Guerrouj et al. [8] investigated the relationship between poor design practices (lexical smells) and change- and fault-proneness. It found that lexi- cal smells can make classes, involved in design smells, more fault-prone. This study also demonstrated that classes with design-smells only are more change- and fault-prone than those with lexical smells only. 1.2.2 Change- and Fault-proneness and Object-oriented Metrics Studies by Lu et al. [1] investigated the relationship between object-oriented metrics and change-proneness. Lu’s paper employed statistical techniques to examine the ability of 62 different OO metrics to predict change-proneness. The study revealed that size metrics exhibited moderate/almost moderate ability in differentiating change-prone classes from non-change prone ones; it also found that cohesion and coupling metrics are less able to predict change-proneness with inheritance metric being the poorest to predict it. Malhotra et al. [9] used software metrics to show that machine learning methods are comparable to the previously used logistics regression methods when it comes to predicting change-proneness; it also showed that testing based on change-proneness prediction leads to better quality as it allows developers to target the most change-prone classes. A paper by Singh et al. [10] also examined the ability of OO metrics to predict different levels of fault severity. The study showed that using machine learning methods to target classes with different severity levels of faults might help developers to better plan and test the fault-prone parts. Pai et al. [5] use Bayesian methods to analyse the fault -content and -proneness by relating the internal OO metrics of software to external quality metrics. Another research by Malhotra et al. [2] investigates the relationship between OO metrics and change-proneness using machine learning and statistical techniques. It also concludes that using these techniques to predict the change-proneness of classes in object-oriented systems is a better approach than regression techniques. Finally, the ability of complexity metrics to predict fault-prone classes in object-oriented systems was investigated by Zhou et al. [11]; it found that many metrics such as LOC, WMC, and AMC showed a moderate or almost moderate ability to predict fault- proneness. The study also concluded that LOC and WMC (weighted method McCabe complexity) are better indicators of fault-proneness.",6239,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1454014/FULLTEXT01.pdf,FALSE,FALSE

Within the altruistic motives, the interviewees have been clear in explaining the receivers, for example, the family and relatives' circumstances in the home country, which means that they need financial support.","In this concluding chapter, we summarize and discuss the conclusion of the study together with reflections on the study's results and implementation. The chapter is rounded off with suggestions for further research that could supplement and broaden the knowledge about the study area further. The purpose of this study is to investigate, analyze, and gain an in-depth understanding of what motives migrants have that make them remit and how they are affected socially and economically by sending remittances from Sweden. A qualitative approach was taken, and eight semi-structured interviews with Swedish migrants with Iraqi and Somali backgrounds were conducted in order to collect data for analysis. The study resulted in the conclusion that most of the interviewees' motives were that they send remittances to family, and relatives because of altruism. Within the altruistic motives, the interviewees have been clear in explaining the receivers, for example, the family and relatives' circumstances in the home country, which means that they need financial support. We identified that some interviewees sent remittances and supported their parents in the home country to maintain favor in inheritance. Another reason we identified is tempered altruism or enlightened self-interest, that some interviewees remit with the intention of helping their family but also returning home, they invest in family and home. The interviewees informed us of their experience regarding the social and economic impact of sending remittances. They state that despite difficulties, they choose to continue to remit to their families in their origin country. The interviewees don’t see their social situation being impacted by sending remittances. Our interviewees’ production activity is that they can speak the language, work, pay taxes, follow laws, and hence they don’t see themselves as socially excluded from the majority of the society. We found that what mattered most to our interviewees was their social activity, they interact with mainstream society and identify with a cultural group in the host country. Their transnational ties are very important for them, and if they did not have them, they feel that they may have seen themselves socially excluded. However, they express how their economic situation is impacted by sending money to their families in the origin country. Almost all of our interviewees informed us how their saving activity is impacted by sending remittances and this indicates that they are socially excluded. The other economic factor that is impacted by remittances is the interviewees’ consumption, for example, they don’t have the resources for hobbies. The interviewees who remit too often did not choose to have an activity in their free time that required them to pay for it, because they thought that the family in the homeland would need the money. Since this research is not extensive enough to draw general conclusions, we can only say that some people can be impacted socially and economically by sending remittances, and there may be a larger social pattern. To find this out, a larger and more comprehensive study must be done with more respondents. As this study is not comprehensive enough to be able to draw a general conclusion about this, we can only state that it is prevalent for some individuals such as our interviewees. It can be said that our interviewees are in a state of limited economic, social and cultural resources and opportunities, because remittances limit their economy, so they cannot maintain a socially acceptable presence in Sweden according to Burchardt et al. (1999) social exclusion concept. Our interviewees don’t see their social situation as socially excluded from the majority of society, however, we have noticed that they didn’t have the opportunity to choose employment themselves to which they are trained. Our interviewees are trained in their homeland as civil engineers, but work as assistant nurses, psychologists as teachers, biomedical researchers as nurses, and pharmacists as opticians. Their choices and thereby opportunities being limited by the fact that they have to send money to their countries of origin and thus force them to prioritize work over education, and other barriers that arise when moving to another country and learning a new language. Our interviewees may be marginalized compared to the majority society and their social position may depend on other factors than their remittances, such as being a migrant. For Swedish society, it is important not to forget that our interviewees are migrants themselves not only live in relationships related to the Swedish context but also live in a network of transnational relationships, which have gone far beyond the borders of Sweden. The interviewees have expressed that they have better living standards than their families in the origin country. This is a comparison, where the migrants try to compare their living conditions and living standards with their families in the country of origin. Their situation depends on whom or with whom the migrant compares. People who compare themselves with Swedish measures may think they are socially excluded, while those who compare themselves with their country of origin may not see themselves as socially excluded at all, but quite the opposite. Our interviewees have fled from war-torn countries and if they try to compare their living conditions and standards with their families in the origin country then of course they will not see themselves as socially excluded. However, the interviewees have expressed several times how content they are with what they have and how they are helping and being an important person to their families and relatives. This study’s results are similar to previous research’s results and this was noticed during our interviews. The previous research was conducted in different countries, but their findings were somehow similar. Our results were no different, it showed that remittances impact Swedish migrants similarly. This study’s result contributes to the previous research, a result that is based on Swedish migrants, especially on the Iraqi and Somali communities. Something that we felt was missing in this study is a larger selection. We could have had a larger selection, but given the ongoing pandemic of Covid-19, the number of our interviewees were limited to only eight persons. The information our interviewees decided to share with us was sensitive, and therefore it was hard to find interviewees. We got turned down by one who did not have a residence permit and citizenship, and another acquaintance who did not feel comfortable sharing this type of information. We also noticed that in order to get this information, we had to ask private and sensitive questions, even though we got honest answers, we noticed the interviewees lowered their voices and took their time when they answered. In this study, we could have used less sensitive and personal questions, and in a way, we could have rephrased some questions. The majority of our respondents were our acquaintances and because we, the authors have migration backgrounds we were able to find interviewees. However, someone with another background might have a hard time findinginterviewees or they might find interviewees that shy away from the questions. The disadvantage of interviewing our acquaintances is that they didn’t want to elaborate on some answers as they think that we know about their situations. They were a little embarrassed to tell us about their financial situation, but because we knew them, we could fill in some of their information, and of course, we did it with their permission. The other interviewees that were not our acquaintances were also a bit shy to share their experience with us and since we don’t know their life as much as our acquaintances we interpreted and concluded their answers the way they have answered the questions. There was no way that we could prevent this because as mentioned earlier the pandemic and this phenomenon being a sensitive one has resulted in these consequences. Based on our study we have identified several phenomena in this remittances sender field that would require deeper research. Several interviewees mentioned how they have received remittances when they lived in the homeland. They have explained to us that sending remittances is something that generations pass to each other. Therefore, we suggest a study based on second-generation migrants’ experience with remittances if sending remittances is something generations pass to each other. Another suggestion is, as our interviewees mentioned, they are economically limited and that remittances are one of the factors resulting from this. Therefore, it will be interesting to study how the children of first-generation migrants have been impacted by their parents sending money to the origin country. It would also be interesting to study how Covid-19 has impacted remittances, especially the sender. Our interviewees have mentioned that they have struggled this year because of the pandemic, however, all of them have continued remitting in 2020. As mentioned earlier remittance is expected to fall 14% by 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It will be interesting to study how the senders plan their future remittances and their experience with the pandemic in relation to remittances.",9403,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1532847/FULLTEXT01.pdf,FALSE,FALSE

Importantly, the assistance offered transcends regional affiliations and is often driven by a combination of humanitarian concerns and familial responsibilities. Given the enduring impact of the civil war on many Somalis, whether the support provided is primarily motivated by religious obligation, humanitarian values, or familial ties can be complex and multifaceted.",,"This chapter introduces previous research about the topic we chose to study. Creswell and Creswell (2018) purpose is that once researchers have identified a topic that can and should be studied, they can start searching for relevant literature on that topic. In this chapter, we have decided to divide the previous research into two parts. In the first part of this chapter, we 9 present previous research that studied the motivation behind sending remittances. The second part presents how remittances impact the sender’s life in the host country. We have chosen to divide this chapter like this as our purpose of this thesis is to find out our interviewees’ motives for sending remittances, as well as their experience of the social and economic impact of sending remittances. At the end of this chapter, we present a summary of previous research. The previous research brings us an insight into other research regarding remittance and we will be able to strengthen our analysis with the help of the arguments of the chosen research. 2.1 Motivations behind remittances Sarvendra Tharmalingam (2011) discusses first-generation Tamils and Somalis in Norway remittance practice and how it impacts the sending families and individuals. Tharmalingam (2011) divides the Tamils and Somalis practices of remittances categories into five different categories. One of the relevant categories that the author tries to focus on is the family-oriented remittances which are the most important to Tamils and Somalis because both communities are bound by traditional and moral obligations; therefore, remittances have become an obligation. The interviewees expressed that they are pressured to send remittances to their families and relatives, or they will face the risk of punishment for their behavior by their family and even by the community. According to Tharmalingam (2011), the migrants that feel pressured to send remittances can be characterized as a practice of forced transnationalism. Paerregaard’s (2015) study argues against scholars and policymakers that say remittances are driven by altruistic reasons and are more resistant to uncertainty than other capital flows. Paerregaard (2015) does an ethnographic examination of remittance sent by Peruvian migrant families. In his study, he suggests that pure altruism constitutes the motivation for remittances, which makes it a relatively stable flow of money. However, it is also found that this flow of money is often short-lived. The finding in Perregaard (2015) is that a strong sense of altruism and contractual commitments drive the shortest remittance time, however, emotional remittances, commitment, non-utilitarian motives, and selfish motives drive the longest time. Paerregaard’s (2015) evidence shows that although the driving force for remittances in Peru is the concern of immigrants with their families, their motivations are 10 often far from non-utilitarians, and the duration and intensity of their remittance commitments to close relatives vary greatly. Paerregaard (2015) refers to Lucas and Stark’s study and say they believe that although pure altruism is usually the driving force of short-term remittances (Stark, 1995), the fusion of mutual altruism, tempered altruism, and enlightened self-interest a combination of altruism and self-interest, is more likely to contribute to the development of long-term remittances (Lucas & Stark, 1985:913). Kankonda Bukasa (2010) investigates the Congolese migrants in South Africa and their remittances, moreover how they are affected by that. According to Kankonda Bukasa (2010), most research on remittances fails to capture the personal and family significance of migrants’ remittances, not only in their transnational social relations but also in their cultural background. Therefore, Kankonda Bukasa (2010) decided to study the social culture of the interviewees and study the motivations of Congolese migrants living in Johannesburg. According to Kankonda Bukasa (2010), the concept of altruism does not promote the study of how and why transnational family relationships are negotiated through behaviors in any meaningful way. Kleist (2018:59-60) describes the Swedish Somali diaspora motivation for engagement in development as a sense of moral obligation. She continues to say that the Somali diaspora’s commitment or obligation is based on their culture and religion. Hence why they remit and support their kinship. Many adult Somali Swedes and Somalis in other parts of the world have participated in this practice. Besides, people have widely expressed donations for drought relief and other forms of disaster donations. This is a common practice, that is, little or no attention is paid to the affiliation of certain regions, but based on a sense of urgency and solidarity, even for the economy, the same is true for people with very limited means. Also, because many Somalis suffered physical pain during the civil war, or had family members or friends who were or have been affected, it is not always clear if they remit because of religious and humanitarian obligations or because they feel responsible for their family. Other motivations Kleist (2018:62) mentions are personal ambitions such as achieving status positioning oneself in the political landscape in the Somali region, especially if aspiring to a political career. Although this is not specific for those who aspire to return to their origin country, however, the political engagement goes hand in hand with the Somali diaspora’s engagement in their homeland’s development.",5566,,TRUE,TRUE
Paraphrasing,Large Source Text,TRUE,"The conflict holds particular significance for NATO and EU member states, particularly those, like Ukraine, with historical ties to the Soviet Union. As the Russia-Ukraine conflict escalates from a domestic issue to a global geopolitical struggle, it poses substantial risks of creating adversarial relationships among major powers and other nations worldwide.",,"It is no denying that Russia and China are currently the main political threats and rivals to the United States in its status as the global political superpower as they are convinced to be adversely disenfranchised being outside of the G7 international leadership (Zambakari, 2022). According to Yousaf et al. (2022), in a likely alliance with other fast-developing nations, like China, which has recently shown its allegiance towards Russia, the threat has increased. Guided by this understanding, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is an evidence of the rivalry. Russia is convinced that being omitted from the G7 status to have a direct influence on the international decision-making table is impeding the ability to advance its interests. Thus, there is a feeling that Russia’s time of staying in the G-20 ranking is long overdue and it ought to advance to a much superior status. One of the European allies that Russia is maximally persuaded that it must hold control of to safeguard its international interest is Ukraine (Alam et al., 2022).9 With the United States being the dominant force exercising influence of NATO, NATO’s expansion in Europe is equally a threat to Russia. Therefore, owing to NATO’s intention to expand its dominance in Europe, with one of its most targeted alliance partners in the European Union (EU) being Ukraine, the issue remains of great interest to the Russian government. On one hand, the Russian military presence in Ukrainian territories and the annexation of the Crimea has been considered as an action that violates the Western democracy. On the other hand, the NATO enlargement led by the United States is considered a threat by Russia (Okoro et al., 2020). Based on these precedents, Russia-Ukraine war is a crisis that has developed into a geopolitical power struggle between Russia and the United States. The United States is committed to expanding its NATO membership in Europe, while Russia is not willing to let go off its former Soviet states such as Ukraine. As a result, these inherent dynamics have pivoted the Russia-Ukraine war as one of the possible components of supremacy battle between Russia and United States for the super power status. However, Ukraine is in a political dilemma. Ukraine has progressively seeming aligned to the NATO, as the country’s leadership believes it has the liberty to charter its independent national and international path (Simons, 2022). At the same time, Ukraine remains under great territorial control of Russia. Russia believes that if Ukraine enters into a NATO membership, then this would be a big loss. It would mean a dramatic altering of the power balance in the Black Sea region, which Russia cannot allow to happen since its black sea fleet in stationed in Crimea. Notably, the Orange Revolution (2004 - 2005) that happened in Kyiv10 (Capital of Ukraine) was anchored on opposing the influence of Russian politics on the constitutionally independent Ukraine. Additionally, the revolution was based on the incentives of this upheaval being vested on protests against the invigorating corruption and the demand to spearhead the institutionalization of its democracy (Khodunov, 2022). Nevertheless, owing to the reality of Ukrainian society being linguistically, religiously, and ethnically divided, the endeavor has been from actuated. In fact, some regions in Ukraine such as Luhansk and Donetsk Provinces and the Crimean Peninsula, strongly identify themselves to be belonging to Russia. Admittedly, the invasion by the Russian military in Crimea in 2014 did serve to initiate the international conflict between Russia and Ukraine, that has remained prevalent to date (Cosgrove, 2020). Hence, the Russian-Ukraine war is a political crisis that is extremely complicated as it has been founded on an issue presenting the likelihood of conflicting interests. The contradictory nature of the war has pitched a conspiracy making it difficult on who between, Russian President, Vladimir Putin, and Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, should be held guilty as responsible for the instigation and sustained prevalence of the war. The crisis has subsequently been argued as presenting the risk of escalating into a Cold War, which could put the normal world order to a severe imminent threat (Guchua et al., 2022). The threat can potentially be associated with a probable emergence of the Third World War, if not settled by the Intergovernmental Governmental Organizations (IGOs). Therefore, the Russia-Ukraine crisis justifies the need to investigate the contributing factors11 to the ongoing war and determine the role that IGOs can play in settling the problem. Presently, there is a question as to whether the ongoing Russia-Ukraine is threatening the world order or not. With this emerging concern, there is a strong relevance of this thesis in the field of political science at large as it examines a topic that is recent and up-to-date in the global political debate. As posited by Legvold (2014), in the global political sphere, the current crisis in Ukraine has permeated a fear that Russia can once again advance a path seeking to help in once again become a great power as it used to be in the Soviet years. As the war is ongoing, it has created a likelihood in the future of resulting into a severe conflict between the United States and Russia. The conflict embodies the risk of consequently having adverse effects of all the state positions of affiliated allies in the international system. The war thus makes itself of particular relevance for the NATO states and EU states, especially in regards to states such as Ukraine that were formerly aligned to the Soviet Union. Considering that the Russia-Ukraine war has already advanced from a national crisis into a global geopolitical conflict, it risks resulting into serious adversaries towards the main actors and other nations in general. With the Russia-Ukraine war being a crisis that pits two great powers, Russia and the United States, against each other, with each already recording their interests to dominate the targeted Ukrainian regions, it seems the war is far from being resolved. Hence, this study is of significance as it helps understand the existence of underlying reasons triggering the war. Creating this understanding would be vital in establishing the role that IGOs can play to hinder the escalation of the crisis early enough as well avoid the possibility of reoccurrence in the future. This study seeks to provide a two-sided view of the Russia-Ukraine war by evaluating its underlying triggers and examining the efforts to address the conflict from an international perspective. Therefore, the primary purpose of the study is to examine the diverse, but coordinated roles that IGOs are mandated to play in helping settle the Russia-Ukraine war. These roles are reported in line with understanding the underlying causes contributing to the crisis with the consideration of both the domestic and global lenses of influence on the war",7014,,FALSE,TRUE
Paraphrasing,Large Source Text,TRUE,"The historical artifacts nestled within Swedish forests face a threat from the routine use of heavy machinery during soil preparation, scarification, and regeneration endeavors. The risk arises primarily from the lack of precise information regarding the whereabouts of these remnants or inaccuracies in their documentation. Among the most fragile of these historical vestiges are the remnants of past charcoal production, whose traces have endured over time.",,"Historical remains in Swedish forests are at risk of being damaged by heavy machinery during regular soil preparation, scarification, and regeneration activities. The reason for this is that the exact locations of these remains are often unknown or their records are inaccurate. Some of the most vulnerable historical remains are the traces left after years of charcoal production. In this thesis, we design and implement a computer vision artificial intelligent model capable of identifying these traces using two accessible visualizations of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data. The model we used was the ResNet34 Convolutional Neural Network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The model took advantage of the image segmentation approach and required only a small number of annotations distributed on original images for training. During the process of data preparation, the original images were heavily augmented, which bolstered the training dataset. Results showed that the model can detect charcoal burners sites and mark them on both types of LIDAR visualizations. Being implemented on modern frameworks and featured with state-of-art machine learning techniques, the model may reduce the costs of surveys of this type of histor- ical remains and thereby help save cultural heritage. Sweden is mostly covered by forests [1]. One of the issues in Swedish forestry is dam- aging historical remains when heavy machinery is used for scarification, soil preparation, and regeneration felling activities. In a recently held nationwide survey performed by The Swedish Forestry Agency (SKS), it was stated that 4 out of 10 cultural heritage sites in the forest were damaged by regeneration felling activities [2]. Moreover, serious damage was caused by soil scarification, forest machines, logging residue, and wind-felled trees [3]. The Register of Ancient Monuments (FMIS) in Sweden has a database of all the recorded ancient remains in the country [4]. Even though the database provides information of about 1.7 million items, it does not show a complete picture of all the historical remains to be found in Sweden [4]. It has been estimated by SKS that 75 % of all ancient remains in Sweden are located in the forest and that 75 % of the forest area is not fully surveyed [5]. Performing the surveys is expensive as fieldwork time is costly and requires archaeology experts to be involved [6]. One type of historical remains to be found in Sweden is charcoal burner sites, known in Swedish as Kolbotten. These constitute the most common type of historical remains situated in the forest, which makes them also the most frequently damaged type [7]. The charcoal fuel industry has been vital for Swedish iron production from the Middle Ages all the way up to the 19th century, when blast furnaces and railroads came into use [7]. Despite the large number of charcoal-related historical remains, knowledge of Swedish charcoal production is still rather limited [7]. Charcoal burner sites were not systematically registered during two rounds of historical remains inventorying. Instead they were mostly transferred into FMIS from isolated surveys or forest history project’s records [7]. Therefore, identifying the locations of charcoal burner sites is crucial for their preservation and availability as an archaeological source [7]. The charcoal burner sites create an important link between scientific archeological research and local cultural history, which benefits the promotion of cultural heritage [7]. As long as maps, images, and other geographic information (geodata) of Swedish landscape including LIDAR telemetry, are publicly available, [8] it seems possible to apply artificial intelligence (AI) to the information and create an algorithm for finding these historical remains. The existence of such an algorithm may benefit both Swedish forestry and Swedish cultural heritage. Attempts to locate different historical remains using AI have been made before. In 2016, scientists from the Norwegian Computer Center represented their approach to detecting charcoal kilns in Norway using Convolutional Neural Networks for feature extraction and then applying the features to ML classifiers. Their approach aimed to improve the previously used Semi-Automatic technique, which is based on pattern recognition. One limitation of their approach was the lack of the exact locations of the kilns. The reason for this limitation was the use of a linear classifier, which does not show an exact position but only says whether the kilns are present on an image. However, their approach showed high prediction accuracy, allowing for the detection of 84.5 % of the known kilns in the training dataset [9]. In 2020, a group of scientists also applied ML algorithms to LIDAR data in order to reveal ancient artifacts. They used LIDAR data images from the ancient city of Angamuco, Mexico, for which archaeologists visually identified and mapped local features. Those images were fed to deep-learning classifiers in order to train a labeling model. As the result, they trained more than 30 classifiers and showed promising accuracy figures. However, their approach required manual annotations of the objects. These annotations have been collected during several surveys by multiple archaeologists on the order of years [10]. Another group of scientists applied multitemporal ML to remote sensing big data for the detection of archaeological mounds in Pakistan. They used a classifier algorithm against a large-scale collection of synthetic-aperture radar and multi-spectral images, resulting in an accurate probability map for mound-like signatures. The results showed that the area contains many more archaeological mounds than previously found. To achieve their goals they used publicly available multi-spectral satellite images. Even though this information is publicly available for non-commercial use, the coverage of the data is poor while temporal and spatial resolution is limited [11]. Finally, a group of scientists from Slovakia used a dataset from the Pacunam LIDAR Initiative survey of the lowland Maya region in Guatemala to identify Mayan structures using ML models. They explored and compared two models, U-Net and Mask R-CNN, for semantic segmentation. In the study, they proved that a U-Net-based model performed better and was capable of correctly identifying 60–66% of all objects. To achieve these results, they also used manually labeled annotations made by archaeology experts, which can be considered as a limitation of their work since it requires the presence of archaeology experts to apply this approach to another domain [12].",6656,,TRUE,TRUE
Paraphrasing,Large Source Text,TRUE,"In recent decades, international migration has seen consistent growth, presenting a challenge for many countries in terms of integrating immigrants into the labor market. Existing research indicates that immigrants, particularly those from non-European backgrounds, face difficulties in gaining a foothold in the labor market, with variations observed between male and female immigrants. Discrimination is proposed as a potential explanation for the disadvantaged position of non-European immigrants in the labor market, often manifested through negative attitudes towards immigrants.",," International migration has had a steady growth over the last decades and the integration of immigrants into the labour market is a challenge for many countries. Previous literature has found that immigrants, especially non-European immigrants, are disadvantaged in the labour market, and that the size of this disadvantage differs between male and female immigrants. One potential explanation for non-European immigrants’ labour market disadvantage is discrimination, which can be expressed through negative attitudes towards immigrants. Using individual data from the European Social Survey, this paper investigates whether there is a relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and the employment gap between non-European immigrants and natives in Sweden, and whether this relation differs by gender. The results, however not statistically significant, indicate that there is a negative relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and the immigrant-native employment gap. Moreover, the female immigrant-native employment gap is found to be more negatively affected by negative attitudes towards immigrants. The flow of people across international borders with the intention of settling in a new country is defined as international migration. International migration and the number of international migrants has had a steady growth over the last decades. However, the current pandemic, COVID-19, has affected all aspects in the global arena. With national borders closing, traveling rates decreasing and the overall insecure situation in the world, all forms of mobility have been disrupted. Yet, in 2020 there were still 281 million people who were living in a country that was not their country of origin. Today, about 3.6 percent of the world’s population are international migrants (United Nations, 2021). The share of people living in Sweden who were not born in Sweden amounted to 19.7 percent in 2020. This corresponds to approximately 2 million people. Also, the number of non-European immigrants has increased. In 2020, Syria and Iraq were the most common countries of origin among immigrants in Sweden (SCB, 2021). As immigrants, and especially refugees, are more likely to have lower income and be unemployed, one of the major political challenges in Sweden and in many other European countries has been that of employment integration of immigrants (e.g. Bevelander, 2011; Aldén and Hammarstedt, 2015; Rydgren, 2006; Arai and Vilhelmsson, 2004; Grand and Szulkin, 2002). The immigrant-native employment gap in Sweden is actually one of the largest among the OECD countries. This fact is troubling when considering the size of the foreign born population in Sweden (OECD/European Union, 2015). For this reason, it is imperative that we understand why the employment gap between immigrants and natives arises and what can be done to improve the labour market situation for immigrants. However, immigrants are not homogenous. Non-European immigrants have a lower employment rate and a higher share of unemployed than both natives and European immigrants(Aldén and Hammarstedt, 2015). Moreover, immigrant men and women face different challenges in the Swedish labour market. In 2018, the immigrant-native employment gap was 18 percentage points for women and 11 percentage points for men (Arbetsmarknadsrapport, 2019), implying that immigrant women might have a longer employment integration process. It has been shown that non-European immigrant women originating from African and Asian countries are particularly disadvantaged compared to non-European immigrant men and native women (Aldén and Hammarstedt, 2015). Factors such as education, labour market experience and language skills could explain why employment integration might differ between men and women. Another important factor that could explain why there is an immigrant-native employment gap and why it might differ by gender is discrimination. Especially non-European immigrant women might suffer from ethnic and gender discrimination in the labour market (Statskontoret, 2018). Since discrimination towards immigrants can be expressed through negative attitudes towards immigrants, overcoming these negative attitudes could improve the labour market situation of immigrants (Constant et al, 2009). Research has shown that individuals with negative attitudes towards immigrants often believe that immigrants will steal their jobs, increase crime rates and become an economic burden to society. However, the labour market situation of immigrants is not only affected by negative attitudes. Other possible obstacles are stereotypes and implicit prejudices. In Sweden, it has been found that Arab-Muslims are targets of negative implicit prejudices to a greater extent compared to natives (Agerström and Rooth, 2009). In light of what has been presented above, the aim of this paper is to examine whether there is a relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and the employment gap between non-European immigrants and natives in Sweden, and whether this relation differs by gender. In this way, we investigate if the immigrant-native employment gap can be partially explained by negative attitudes towards immigrants in Sweden. Based on this, we aim to answer the following research question: Is there a relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and non-European immigrants’ employment probabilities in Sweden and does the relation differ by gender? We look at the immigrant-native employment gap for men and women separately since previous studies have shown that immigrant men and women are disadvantaged and discriminated against to different degrees (e.g. Arai et al, 2016; Ek et al, 2020; Raijman and Semyonov, 1997). In order to answer this research question, we used individual data from the European Social Survey (ESS). We combined data from four different survey years (2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016) and estimated a linear probability model for the probability of being employed. To explore if there is a relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and the immigrant-native employment gap, we interacted an attitude measure with a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the individual is a non-European immigrant and 0 if the individual is born in Sweden. We estimated a regression for men and women separately to explore if the relation differs by gender. In this paper, the attitude measure stands for the share of individuals having negative attitudes towards immigrants in 14 different regions in Sweden. The respondents of the ESS were presented with the following statement: “Immigrants make [the] country [a] worse or better place to live”. This statement is used when constructing the attitude measure. This paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways. Firstly, this study investigates negative attitudes towards immigrants in Sweden as an explanation for the employment gap between non-European immigrants and natives in different regions in Sweden. Secondly, this study sheds light on whether negative attitudes towards immigrants affect the immigrant-native employment gap differently for men and women. The remaining of this paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical framework for the paper. Section 3 presents a review of relevant previous literature. Section 4 presents the data used in the paper and descriptive statistics of the data. Section 5 presents the methodological framework for the paper. Section 6 presents the results. Section 7 presents a discussion of the results. Finally, section 8 presents concluding remarks. ",7614,,TRUE,TRUE

Articles related to e-maintenance was studied and analyzed to know the steps to implement a cost-effective e-maintenance. The authors came up with a model that describes the implementation process in three main steps. Nowadays, industrial environment which is global competitive marketplace press to continuously reduce costs of unscheduled downtime, unexpected breakdowns and delaying because of repair time. These are non-value activities and cause the costs. Automation and mechanization are increased and more important than before. Therefore, maintenance became more complex, Alsyouf (2007). Thanks to well maintenance operations, these costs can be reduced. Maintenance is one of the important subjects in improving company's competitiveness; also maintenance affects the future of the company. (Campell and Jardine, 2001). Al-Najjar (2007) states that maintenance influences the company’s internal effectiveness, also maintenance performance affects quality, production and their cost. Although maintenance is closely related to production and quality, most of the companies see maintenance as a cost center and not profit activities (Al-Najjar, 2007). If there are no well maintenance functions, machines fail too often and it may cause speed losses and low performance. Also maintenance policy increases the production capacity and capability of the machines (Al-Najjar and Alsyouf, 2003). Maintenance effects on production and quality could be seen by the OEE. Al-Najjar (2007) claims that maintenance is one of the most important cause for losses that can cause low OEE. Moreover, production losses, failures and technical faults could be corrected by effective maintenance functions. Therefore optimizing maintenance functions helps the company’s competitiveness and it is not a cost center, maintenance should be seen as a profit center (Al-Najjar, 2007). Holmberg et al (2010), claims that maintenance is directly linked to management of people, asset and technologies. He also states that the aim of these areas in maintenance perspective is using expensive resources with high performance to take advantage of them and use limited resources effectively to better service. Because of that maintenance has become important and methods such as condition-based maintenance (CBM), Total quality maintenance (TQMain), reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), total- productive maintenance (TPM) developed for working efficiently in the last 30 years (Campbell and Jardine, 2001). Tsang (2002), claims that the term of e-Maintenance has emerged in 2000. At the present there are many different definitions of e-Maintenance but still there is no well-defined and established definition. According to Karim (2010), most of the researchers describe e-maintenance only limited perspective and mainly these definitions are technical. He claims that the reason of the lack of well definition is that there is no any definition which is multidisciplinary and not limited set of perspective. Marquez (2008) defines the term of e-Maintenance as “Maintenance support which includes the resources, services and management necessary to enable proactive decision process execution.

Paraphrasing,Large Source Text,TRUE,"Adopting a strategy of performing maintenance actions solely in response to breakdowns is not always optimal. Breakdowns can lead to increased costs and unexpected downtime, particularly when they occur at inconvenient times. Moreover, such breakdowns may trigger secondary issues or escalate into larger problems. Scheduled maintenance offers a solution to mitigate these risks by proactively stopping equipment at regular intervals for inspection and repair, thereby minimizing the likelihood of unexpected breakdowns and their associated consequences. ",,"Nowadays, industrial environment which is global competitive marketplace press to continuously reduce costs of unscheduled downtime, unexpected breakdowns and delaying because of repair time. These are non-value activities and cause the costs. Automation and mechanization are increased and more important than before. Therefore, maintenance became more complex, Alsyouf (2007). Thanks to well maintenance operations, these costs can be reduced. Maintenance is one of the important subjects in improving company's competitiveness; also maintenance affects the future of the company. (Campell and Jardine, 2001). Al-Najjar (2007) states that maintenance influences the company’s internal effectiveness, also maintenance performance affects quality, production and their cost. Although maintenance is closely related to production and quality, most of the companies see maintenance as a cost center and not profit activities (Al-Najjar, 2007). If there are no well maintenance functions, machines fail too often and it may cause speed losses and low performance. Also maintenance policy increases the production capacity and capability of the machines (Al-Najjar and Alsyouf, 2003). Maintenance effects on production and quality could be seen by the OEE. Al-Najjar (2007) claims that maintenance is one of the most important cause for losses that can cause low OEE. Moreover, production losses, failures and technical faults could be corrected by effective maintenance functions. Therefore optimizing maintenance functions helps the company’s competitiveness and it is not a cost center, maintenance should be seen as a profit center (Al-Najjar, 2007). Holmberg et al (2010), claims that maintenance is directly linked to management of people, asset and technologies. He also states that the aim of these areas in maintenance perspective is using expensive resources with high performance to take advantage of them and use limited resources effectively to better service. Because of that maintenance has become important and methods such as condition-based maintenance (CBM), Total quality maintenance (TQMain), reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), total- productive maintenance (TPM) developed for working efficiently in the last 30 years (Campbell and Jardine, 2001). Tsang (2002), claims that the term of e-Maintenance has emerged in 2000.At the present there are many different definitions of e-Maintenance but still there is no well-defined and established definition. According to Karim (2010), most of the researchers describe e-maintenance only limited perspective and mainly these definitions are technical. He claims that the reason of the lack of well definition is that there is no any definition which is multidisciplinary and not limited set of perspective. Marquez (2008) defines the term of e-Maintenance as “Maintenance support which includes the resources, services and management necessary to enable proactive decision process execution. This support includes e-technologies (i.e. ICT, Web-based, tether-free, wireless, infotronics technologies), but also, e-Maintenance activities (operations or processes) such as e-monitoring, e-diagnosis and e-prognosis”.

Also he identified “e” as: “e(nterprisse)” that it adds value directly to enterprise performance. Baldwin (2001) claims that result of adding up the “e”s and e-maintenance means e(xcellent) maintenance. Mostly it is not always a good strategy to perform maintenance actions after a breakdown occurs. The breakdown may cause more cost and unexpected stoppage when it happens in a non-convenient time. Also the breakdown may cause secondary problems or it could become sources of other big problems. Scheduled maintenance may become a solution for this problem in the form of stopping the equipment routinely for checking and repairing. The weakness of scheduled maintenance is that sometimes the equipment may stop in unnecessary cases; also the stop for checking may cause a problem. Knowing the condition of equipment in real time also controlling component information, repairing and service activity time is the optimal solution (Holmberg et al, 2010). Existing and new technologies open a new possibility for maintenance. As E- Maintenance, observing the device performance is available to use low cost micro size integrated sensors also technology provide condition data collection, data mining, signal analysis, reasoning and decision making. Communications and transport data is so easy by using wireless techniques with mobile handheld computers (PDA, Personal digital assistant), (Holmberg and Helle 2008). By using the e-maintenance, availability and customer value can be increased also life cycle cost can be reduced. It provides various benefits like remote capabilities of connectivity, data collection, configuration, performance monitoring, and analysis of equipment to maintain the equipment. Also through e-Maintenance, equipment may have near zero downtime, Hung (2004). Karim (2010), states that industrial systems can have more proactive, effective, efficient and more cost-sustainable maintenance by using e-maintenance. In addition, he claims that e-Maintenance is an immature and challenging field. It helps the company’s competitiveness but it lacks of common definitions, widely accepted underlying theories and credible experimental base. The problem is implementing e-maintenance because of the lack of the experimental base. Maintenance in general has a huge impact on the economical aspect of the company. Performance, quality and availability are associated with the maintenance level that is applied in the company. E-maintenance provides new data-collection techniques and alarm systems that will result in immediate maintenance actions after studying the signals provided. Al-Najjar (2001), states that maintenance policy in production system can help to achieve unproblematic operation in the production process. Efficient maintenance policy also helps to have production with the right quality and competitive price. E-Maintenance has emerged around 2000 to have a better maintenance policy, strategy and activities by using new technologies. It is a new concept, therefore it is hard to fully understand and implement it correctly. Also it is hard to know what the requirements to implement it are. This research will study the requirements to implement of e-Maintenance. The research mainly tries to find an answer for what are the requirements and outcomes of implementing e-Maintenance and what are the strengths and weaknesses in ICT and economic perspective of e-maintenance.",7078,,FALSE,FALSE
Paraphrasing,Large Source Text,TRUE,"The cultures of the Middle East, encompassing Turkey as well, share certain common characteristics. Like any other culture, the people of the Middle East possess their distinct set of cultural values, beliefs, and customs. According to Hall, Middle Eastern cultures place a strong emphasis on hospitality and mutual respect. Interviewees from Turkey used terms such as hospitable, respectful, and helpful to characterize the representatives of their culture.",,"High contextual cultures differ from low contextual cultures in having branching structures and more complex communication systems. While low contextual cultures are simpler and more direct, high contextual cultures emphasize the process of communicating information rather than outcomes. High contextual cultures also differ from low contextual cultures in the role of feelings and unspoken rules that govern people's behavior (Hall, 1989). Hall (1989) considers Turkish culture and the culture of the Middle East, in general, to be highly contextual. He defines high contextual cultures as cultures with strong, shared values, norms, and beliefs that are deeply ingrained in society, and that shape the behavior and interactions of its members. Hall (1989) also argues that these cultures emphasize the importance of maintaining social harmony and rely heavily on nonverbal communication to interpret and exchange meaning. High contextual cultures are seen as highly collectivist, with a strong emphasis on social cohesion and interdependence. They place an emphasis on relationships and the importance of maintaining respectful and harmonious interactions. Hall also argues that high contextual cultures are often slow to change, as they rely on traditions, established practices, and religion to guide behavior. One of the interviewees, Ismail, said that in Turkish culture, there are a lot of traditional people, with a mindset that is hard to change. They are too proud of being who they are and are not ready, and don't want to change. Samovar and Porter (2004) divide communication in different cultures into styles that are similar to the context of Hall’s theory. They also say that in cultures that use a high context style, communication is often indirect and assumes shared knowledge and understanding between the participants. These cultures tend to emphasize the relationship between people and emphasize the importance of group harmony. Nonverbal cues such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice are often used to convey meaning. According to Samovar and Porter (2004), high context communication style is common in many Middle Eastern countries, including Turkey, where verbal communication without any nonverbal cues is often seen as impolite or even rude. This communication style relies on reading nonverbal cues and body language to understand the meaning behind what is being said. In Turkey, it is important to be aware of the cultural nuances when engaging in communication. One characteristic that distinguishes high contextual cultures is the manner of speech, which implies that the interlocutor understands the context between the lines. Therefore, in these cultures, the substance of the conversation is not as important as how it was said. As mentioned earlier, non-verbal communication plays an important role in understanding each other and building relationships. Gestures, gazes, signals, and postures speak volumes for representatives of high contextual cultures. Also, the characteristic is the lack of straightforwardness and open expression of discontent (Hall, 1989; Samovar & Porter, 2004). Hall (1989) says that all the cultures of the Middle East, which also includes the culture of Turkey, have some common characteristics. The people of the Middle East, like other cultures, have their own unique set of cultural values, beliefs, and customs. Hall explains that Middle Eastern cultures emphasize hospitality and respect for one another. Hospitable, respectful, and helpful are the words the Turkish interviewees used to describe the representatives of their culture. Hall (1989) also highlights the importance of family and religious values and how they play an important role in the lives of the people of the Middle East. Equally important is the strong sense of community and the importance of the group over the individual. It is also worth mentioning that Middle Eastern culture is traditional with an emphasis on maintaining an orderly and hierarchical society and on respect for elders and the sharing of knowledge, wisdom, and traditions. Hall describes the Turkish people as outgoing but formal, having a strong sense of national pride, and having an impulsive nature. He also emphasizes that they have a strong sense of family loyalty, a strong commitment to tradition, and a strong belief in the importance of hospitality. He describes Turkish culture as highly ritualized in terms of behavior and interaction. Samovar and Porter (2004) say as well that Turkish culture is characterized by its hospitality, respect for family, national pride, and a strong sense of community. This can be explained by the fact that Turkish culture practices more ancient traditions based on family, status, clans, and adherence to the norms of society. Turkish culture emphasizes social conformity and hierarchical structure, as well as ideals such as good manners, decency, and propriety. Also, this culture adheres more to social roles than to individual rights and freedoms (Borzova, 2010). The person is the representative of the family; district; city; country; nation; etc. and is responsible for the good name and honor of the whole (Gutareva & Vinogradov, 2015). High contextual cultures place a high value on relationships and connections, making communication more personal and intimate. People rely on a deep sense of community and trust to understand each other and to build relationships, which they place a much higher value on than individual achievement (Hall, 1989). Trompenaars & Hampden-Turner (2020) argue that Turkish culture is practician, meaning that members of this culture value human relationships first and foremost. Formalities and rules play a secondary role. In particularistic cultures, the decision of any cases is mainly based on relationships and trust. The authors also believe that this culture has a high index of collectivism and belonging. Which indicates the importance of the individual's involvement in the group and the exaltation of the interests of society over individual interests and views. As well as the fact that the status of an individual depends on his belonging to a certain group (kindred or professional affiliation). Trompenaars & Hampden-Turner (2020) also emphasize that Turkish culture is emotional and diffuse. Which means that the representatives of this culture are talkative, vividly express their emotions through words and gestures, and also tend to mix private and public space. Hofstede (2001) also considers Turkish culture to be collectivist. His claim is that inflexible social structures and distinct social groupings are characteristics of collectivist civilizations. The main characteristic of collectivism is giving the group's interests precedence over the individual's, as well as taking into account how one's decisions and deeds will affect the community that is important to them. High degrees of interconnectedness, harmony within the group, personal connections, collaboration, devotion to traditions, feeling of duty, group decision-making, and emotional reliance on the group are all characteristics of these cultures. Turkish culture, according to Hofstede (2001), demonstrates a high power distance. This indicates that people in this culture are ready to accept an unequal distribution of power, see those in positions of authority with adoration, and consider power to be a major component of life. Hall (1989) considers Swedish culture to be low contextual. It is a culture that places less emphasis on formal rules, structures, and procedures and instead values informal relationships and individual discretion. These cultures tend to be more open and flexible, with less emphasis on hierarchy and authority. The Swedes are guided by the rule of equality for each individual, regardless of any of his/her distinctive features (gender, age, sexual orientation, nationality, religious preferences, etc.) (Borzova, 2010). People in these cultures are often expected to think independently and be creative, and they tend to value individual input and opinions. A person in Swedish culture is primarily an individual who has the right to choose and is responsible only for his/her personal actions (Gutareva & Vinogradov, 2015). In a low contextual culture, communication is often direct, open, and informal. People are expected to be open, honest, and direct in their communication (Hall,1989). Low contextual cultures use direct verbal expressions to convey their meaning clearly and without relying on subtle cues from the environment or the people involved. This type of culture is characterized by directness and an emphasis on facts and logic. People in these cultures value time and efficiency and generally prefer to express themselves in concise and direct ways. They are less likely to rely on nonverbal communication and expect others to state their opinion or needs directly (Hall, 1989). Swedish people are open and direct when discussing topics, and not using any unnecessary words or phrases. Their communication is marked by a lack of emphasis on hierarchy, and people of all levels can participate in conversations without feeling like they are out of place (Samovar & Porter, 2004). Swedish people tend to focus on individual achievements and individual responsibility, with less emphasis on collective or shared goals. They place importance on rules and regulations and tend to be less tolerant of ambiguity or deviation from set norms. Low contextual cultures are often characterized by a focus on efficiency and personal achievement, rather than on relationships and social norms. Individualism and independence are highly valued in Swedish culture (Hall, 1989). Samovar and Porter (2004) say that Swedish culture has a low context style. Which means direct communication and focus on the content of the message rather than on the relationship between the participants. Cultures with low context style emphasize individualism, and verbal communication is usually the primary one. Swedish culture is deeply rooted in the country's long-standing commitment to democratic principles and social justice. Swedes are known to be friendly, welcoming, and open to new cultures and experiences. Communication is highly valued in Swedish culture, and Swedes strive to communicate with respect and understanding. Characteristics that distinguish low contextual cultures are a clear expression of one's thoughts without understatement and strong non-verbal communication. For representatives of these cultures, the essence of what was said is important, and not how it was said. The choice of simple and understandable speech to convey a clear assessment of the topic to the interlocutor is also a special characteristic of low contextual cultures. As well as the open and honest expression of disagreement (Hall, 1989; Samovar & Porter, 2004).",10895,,TRUE,TRUE
Paraphrasing,Large Source Text,TRUE,"Global warming poses a pervasive challenge worldwide, with emissions of greenhouse gases serving as a primary contributor. The transport sector, in particular, accounts for a substantial portion of these emissions, exacerbating the issue of global warming. In response, the Swedish government implemented the bonus-malus system in July 2018. This system is designed to incentivize the adoption of eco-friendly vehicles, thereby gradually reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector over time.",,"Global warming issues are a widespread problem around the world and the emissions of greenhouse gases is one of the main contributors. The transport sector emits a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions; thus, this contributes to global warming. To tackle this challenge the Swedish state introduced in July 2018 a system called bonus-malus system which aims to increase the proportion of eco-friendly cars and in the long run reducing greenhouse gases emissions from the transport sector. This paper examines the tax system within the Bonus-Malus system. Primarily investigating if Malus, tax system, impacted the demand for electric vehicles since it introduced. The study conducted based on a short panel data from Sweden´s 21 counties for the period 2016-2020 and the analysis method applied is a regression analysis. The results of this thesis confirm a strong positive relationship between the share of newly registered battery electric vehicles (BEV) and the Malus, but much weaker influence of the other studied variables. Suggesting that tax system induce on emission seem to be efficient at boost the demand for BEV. Our planet's well-being is in a critical state where one of the climate's biggest challenges is the greenhouse effect. Many of the greenhouse gases emitted are originating within the transportation sector. Figures from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (naturvadsverket, 2020) show that emissions of greenhouse gases from transportation account for one third of Sweden’s total emissions. While the transportation sector around the world accounts for 23 percent of the world´s energy-related greenhouse gas emissions (Ma et al., 2019). Thus, it is important that these emissions that are polluting our air are reduced as much as possible at the lowest cost to society. One way to do this is to encourage society to acquire eco-friendly vehicles, such as Electric vehicles (EVs) or Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) which are substitute goods to cars that run on conventional fuel. Many governments around the world subsidies electric vehicles to encourage people to use more EVs which are environmentally friendly compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV). These subsidies are designed to support the governments' goals of electrifying the transportation sector to reduce their national greenhouse gas emissions (Olson, 2015). Since 2012, the Swedish government has provided many high subsidies for the private purchase of electric cars including tax exemptions. According to elbilsstatistik.se (2022), there are total of 341 756 registered EVs in Sweden. In Sweden most of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport sector come from road traffic where emissions from cars dominate. During Covid 19 pandemic, emission from passenger cars have decreased by ten percent and amounted to 9.4 million tons. The reduction is mainly due to declining car traffics during pandemic where the whole society were in partial lockdown (Naturvårdverket, 2021). Although, in recent years, Swedish consumers have shown interest in sustainability, which is a sign that the Swedish society have become more environmentally conscious (Svenskhandel.se, 2018). However, since human activities contribute to climate change and global warming, there is a need to better understand what factors that influence individual’s willingness to change environmentally damaging behaviors, such as using fossil fuel cars, to less harmful ones. The Swedish government have established and adopted climate and energy targets, which enable emission reduction as well upgrade the energy efficiency in the country. In non- trading sectors, greenhouse gas emissions had contracted by 30 percent in 2016 relative to 1990 period. To reach the climate targets, the government took an active approach and introduced the Bonus-Malus system in its budget bill for 2018, along with industrial Leap reform, to support the development of climate smart solutions and accelerate the transition to green and sustainable energy. The Bonus-malus system is a system that mainly applies to passenger cars, but also for light trucks and buses (Sweden’s National Reform Programma, 2018). The policy is divided to two parts, the first part is the bonus, which states that newly purchased vehicles from July the first 2018, is entitled for government subvention, or subject to higher vehicle taxes, which reflect the malus part (Transportstyrelsen, 2022). The incentives mechanism is solely dependent on the vehicle’s emission of carbon dioxide and vehicle year, mainly the vehicle model. Purchased vehicles before 2020 and have a maximum of 60 grams carbon dioxide emission per kilometer, or vehicles that taken into service from 2020 and has maximum dioxide emission of 70 grams per kilometer is eligible for bonuses. However, for Vehicles that that emit more than 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer is subject to Malus, a monetary penalty in form of raised vehicle tax, for cars that taken into service after June 2018, and is into effect during the first three years. The standard vehicle tax is 360 SEK per year for all vehicles that lays within Malus requirements. (Transportstyrelsen, 2021). Then there are further taxes/fees included to the standard tax, based on the fuel used in the vehicle. For instance, gasoline vehicles that emit a minimum of 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer and a maximum of 140 grams, are exposed to addition 82 SEK per gram. Meanwhile, vehicles that emit above 140 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer, are charged additional cost of 107 per gram. Alternatively, diesel driven vehicles have two more fees included, an environmental supplement and fuel supplement. The former consists of a cost of 250 SEK per year, while the latter comprise of a 13,5 SEK per gram of carbon dioxide that emitted (Bilbolaget, 2022). In this research paper, our objective is to assess the policy incentives by the Swedish government the so-called Bonus Malus system, essentially investigating how the monetary penalty of the malus part impacted the demand for EVs across regions, where demand is defined as the share of newly registered BEV. Also, we decided to omit the analysis of the bonus part, mainly due to time constraint as well as data limitation. The study will concentrate on passenger cars class 1, such as cars, SUV, vans, and pickups, while excluding class 2, which mostly incorporate light trucks. We are fully aware that evaluating one segment over the other of the policy may not be optimal and there is a high feasibility that the other segment, the bonus part has impacted the demand for EVs. Considering how the opportunity cost for EVs are reduced due to subsidies up to 60 000 SEK, relative to gasoline and diesel driven vehicles. Pay a close attention to terms such as EVs and BEVs are used interchangeably in the study, to a prevent and intercept any confusion. The rest of this article is structured in 7 sections. In section 2 will present a review of previous research about EVs. In section 3 will be presented the economic theories related to the research question and explanation on relationship between government incentive and the demand for EVs are reviewed.

Applications and data are hosted in data centers managed by third-party providers, utilizing a pay-per-use pricing model. This arrangement enables organizations to prioritize their core business objectives without the burden of overseeing in-house IT infrastructure.",,"Cloud computing provides access to on-demand computing resources and storage space, whereby applications and data are hosted with data centers managed by third parties, on a pay-per-use price model. This allows organizations to focus on core business goals instead of managing in-house IT infrastructure. However, as more business critical applications and data are moved to the cloud, service availability is becoming a growing concern. A number of recent cloud service disruptions have questioned the reliability of cloud environments to host business critical applications and data. The impact of these disruptions varies, but, in most cases, there are financial losses and damaged reputation among consumers. This thesis aims to investigate the threats to service availability in cloud computing and to provide some best practices to mitigate some of these threats. As a result, we identified eight categories of threats. They include, in no particular order: power outage, hardware failure, cyber-attack, configuration error, software bug, human error, administrative or legal dispute, and network dependency. A number of systematic mitigation techniques to ensure constant availability of service by cloud providers were identified. In addition, practices that can be applied by cloud customers and users of cloud services, to improve service availability, were presented. The adoption of cloud computing has grown exponentially over the last few years. One third of all Internet users allegedly visit sites hosted on Amazon AWS cloud infrastructure daily and around one percent of Internet traffic in North America is reportedly served by Amazon AWS. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), Western Europe’s cloud market is expected to grow to 15 billion euros by 2015, from 3.3 billion euros in 2010, translating to a 35% growth [1]. Cloud computing provides on-demand computing resources and storage space on a pay-per-use price model. An obvious benefit of this approach is cost effectiveness: eliminates the need to purchase and maintain in-house servers, scalability: allocated computing resources and storage space can increase or reduce depending on the demand. Despite the benefits, there are potential risks. Between LinkedIn, Twitter and Yahoo password breaches [2] [3] [4], news of cloud security incidents have grabbed headlines in recent months. However, it is not only data breaches security professionals should be worried about, but equally availability breaches. Take for instance, the Amazon AWS cloud outage that occurred in April 2012, which took down many major websites including Reddit, Foursquare, Quora and Hootsuite [5]. This single, widely reported incident brought attention to the availability risks involved in cloud computing. While there were no reports of data breaches, the incident underscores the essentiality of continuous availability of some cloud services. According to a survey conducted by IDC among 263 security professionals in 2009, the number one concern of organizations moving to cloud computing is security, while the second top concern is availability (Figure 1.1). However, because of the increasing migration of mission critical applications and sensitive data to cloud environments, cloud availability is no longer solely associated with accessibility but security as well [6]. After all, you cannot guarantee your data or application on the cloud is safe if you do not have access to them. That is, availability must be first attained, before confidentiality and integrity can be achieved. As more enterprises adopt cloud computing, it is the responsibility of cloud service providers to ensure constant availability of critical business cloud services and data. In addition, cloud consumers can complement this effort through a number of techniques subsequently discussed in this report. Figure 1.1: Challenges/Issues of Cloud Computing (Source = [7]) first attained, before confidentiality and integrity can be achieved. As more enterprises adopt cloud computing, it is the responsibility of cloud service providers to ensure constant availability of critical business cloud services and data. In addition, cloud consumers can complement this effort through a number of techniques subsequently discussed in this report. Despite the fact that cloud computing has become ubiquitous and is gradually becoming technology option for most enterprise IT organizations around the world, there are numerous challenges causing drawbacks which needs to be dealt with. Data privacy and integrity is very paramount to business continuity using cloud solutions but there is one aspect of cloud computing services that remains an issue, and this is availability. The threat against service availability in cloud computing encompasses lack of innovative ideas to ensure constant service delivery, outages problems, lack of operational resilience and lack of infrastructure robustness. These are the major problems definition to be addressed in this research.",5020,,FALSE,FALSE

Consequently, the aim of this research is to explore how Swedish retailers operating in the furniture sector can effectively manage technological touchpoints within customer journeys.",,"The digital world is constantly growing. This contributes to increasing expectations and demands in the technical aspect. Digitization is powerful, but it further contributes to a number of challenges, such as the coordination of physical and digital stores. During the corona pandemic, the digital transformation has accelerated for companies to adapt to customers. Therefore, the purpose of the research is to understand how swedish retailers can manage technological touchpoints in customer journeys in the furniture sector. Further the purpose is to investigate how retailers can use technological touchpoints to change the quality and customer engagement in the customer journey. To be able to answer the empirical findings, six semi-structured interviews were obtained through a multiple case study. The theory from previous research and the empirical results were then discussed in the analysis. The conclusion of the thesis resulted in the management of digital touchpoints is different depending on whether it concerns companies using physical stores or e-commerce. This thesis has identified that retailers in the furniture sector manage technological touchpoints to create a seamless customer experience, increase customer satisfaction, more easily engage customers and to be able to integrate with customers in several ways. Digital touchpoints have made it easier for companies to measure results and to be able to improve the customer journey. One identification was that customer engagement has increased in relation to the increased digitalization, but also that the researched companies believe that digitization is vital for increasing customer engagement. Due to the technology, opportunities are created to be able to develop the quality of the customer journey. Further, by being able to measure the customer journey, the companies gain an insight into what should be constantly improved. The digital world is constantly growing. This contributes to increasing expectations and demands in the technical aspect (Cgi., 2021). Thanks to the digital tools, many opportunities are available, especially to companies and their business activities (Rachinger, Rauter, Müller, Vorraber & Schirgi., 2019). In today's society, people are under time pressure and are becoming increasingly comfortable. Therefore, it simplifies for the customer to shop via the internet instead of going to the store (Svensk handel., 2021). Digitization is powerful, but it further contributes to a number of challenges, such as the coordination of physical and digital stores. The integrationof these channels is an important challenge to process in order to maximize the experience for the customer and be competitive on the market (Handelsradet., 2016). In order for companies to keep up with developments in the digital sector, it is important that it becomes an integral part of the practical aspects of work and the processes in the organizational sector (Morell., 2017). Digitization has reformed how companies deliver value to the customer in a positive way (Enterpriseproject., 2021) and during the corona pandemic, the digital transformation has accelerated for companies to adapt to customers (Internetstiftelsen., 2020). Many physical stores go into bankruptcy because digitalization is constantly evolving and e-commerce is taking over (Taylor & Francis online., 2020). A major problem at the moment is also the pandemic, which means that brick and mortar stores are lacking in operations and the supply chain is destroyed. As a result, an apocalypse is forecast in physical stores, which means that many stores will go bankrupt. For companies that are forced to go bankrupt, omnichannel is an opportunity to be able to keep their business. Omnichannels lead to an increase in the purchase frequency, 2(63) higher order value, more customer loyalty and that customer engagement grows (Taylor & Francis online., 2020). The pandemic has affected the whole world on a large scale and not least the retail trade. E-commerce has increased drastically and has been confronted with enormous challenges regarding sales and security (Handelstrender., 2021). Customer journey is defined as all the stages a consumer goes through during the whole purchase process (Hoyer, Kroschke, Schmitt, Kraume & Shankar., 2020). In order for companies to meet customers’ requirements for the customer journey, it is important to understand customers' expectations. Covid-19 has made the situation more difficult, leading to a change in business strategy among several companies. Companies must find innovative ways to keep their promises to the brand. Using digital touchpoints makes customer service more efficient. This is a difficult task for companies, however a task that is rewarding and an opportunity to change the Customer delivery model, which can be beneficial for the business (Ringman., 2020). During the corona pandemic, digital touchpoints have become more important than ever. Companies need to have a great deal of knowledge about where and how consumers are treated. The companies need to find out where they are going to meet their customers and this is done by a screening of all touchpoints. The screening is done to see to what extent individual touchpoints support customer satisfaction and strengthen the brand (Kantarsifo., 2017). In the furniture company sector, consumers expect meaningful and genuine interactions where and when they are in contact with furniture companies (Volmer., 2012). Touchpoints are important regardless of whether they are physical or digital interactions with the customer and it is therefore a significant factor to carefully check and review each touchpoint within the furniture company. Touchpoints in the furniture sector can include a website, social media, advertising, product catalogs and product reviews. Furniture companies need to understand which touchpoints are relevant to their particular company in order to create a positive experience for the customer (Cadesignform., 2021). It is further discussed that in the future it will mostly be the technology that connects the company and the customers, instead of the use of human touchpoints (Hollebeek, Sprott & Brady., 2021). When integration with customers takes place through the company's touchpoints, speed and relevance are essential. The integration can take place physically or virtually, through a catalog or site-specific text message. Transition or permanent is as well a touchpoint that applies to a conversation between customer and seller or an indirect contact with the company, for example a catalog (Volmer., 2012). To create 3(63) result-rich experiences with touchpoints, three can be concluded: information, immediacy and integration. The information the company provides at each touchpoint is valuable and creates a successful brand strategy. Immediacy is important because customers have high expectations that it will go fast, both through physical and digital  touchpoints. This applies, among other things, to the interaction between the consumer and the company's sales, credit, customer service and delivery department. The integration includes the coordination of experiences of the customer during the shopping trip. It is important for companies to integrate every interaction with the consumer in a seamless way to get customers to where they want to be (Volmer., 2012).",7400,,TRUE,TRUE

This practice is widespread among adult Somali Swedes and Somalis residing in other regions. Additionally, there's a notable trend of contributing to disaster relief efforts, such as drought relief, reflecting a shared commitment to solidarity and urgency. Importantly, the assistance offered transcends regional affiliations and is often driven by a combination of humanitarian concerns and familial responsibilities. Given the enduring impact of the civil war on many Somalis, whether the support provided is primarily motivated by religious obligation, humanitarian values, or familial ties can be complex and multifaceted.",,"This chapter introduces previous research about the topic we chose to study. Creswell and Creswell (2018) purpose is that once researchers have identified a topic that can and should be studied, they can start searching for relevant literature on that topic. In this chapter, we have decided to divide the previous research into two parts. In the first part of this chapter, we 9 present previous research that studied the motivation behind sending remittances. The second part presents how remittances impact the sender’s life in the host country. We have chosen to divide this chapter like this as our purpose of this thesis is to find out our interviewees’ motives for sending remittances, as well as their experience of the social and economic impact of sending remittances. At the end of this chapter, we present a summary of previous research. The previous research brings us an insight into other research regarding remittance and we will be able to strengthen our analysis with the help of the arguments of the chosen research. 2.1 Motivations behind remittances Sarvendra Tharmalingam (2011) discusses first-generation Tamils and Somalis in Norway remittance practice and how it impacts the sending families and individuals. Tharmalingam (2011) divides the Tamils and Somalis practices of remittances categories into five different categories. One of the relevant categories that the author tries to focus on is the family-oriented remittances which are the most important to Tamils and Somalis because both communities are bound by traditional and moral obligations; therefore, remittances have become an obligation. The interviewees expressed that they are pressured to send remittances to their families and relatives, or they will face the risk of punishment for their behavior by their family and even by the community. According to Tharmalingam (2011), the migrants that feel pressured to send remittances can be characterized as a practice of forced transnationalism. Paerregaard’s (2015) study argues against scholars and policymakers that say remittances are driven by altruistic reasons and are more resistant to uncertainty than other capital flows. Paerregaard (2015) does an ethnographic examination of remittance sent by Peruvian migrant families. In his study, he suggests that pure altruism constitutes the motivation for remittances, which makes it a relatively stable flow of money. However, it is also found that this flow of money is often short-lived. The finding in Perregaard (2015) is that a strong sense of altruism and contractual commitments drive the shortest remittance time, however, emotional remittances, commitment, non-utilitarian motives, and selfish motives drive the longest time. Paerregaard’s (2015) evidence shows that although the driving force for remittances in Peru is the concern of immigrants with their families, their motivations are 10 often far from non-utilitarians, and the duration and intensity of their remittance commitments to close relatives vary greatly. Paerregaard (2015) refers to Lucas and Stark’s study and say they believe that although pure altruism is usually the driving force of short-term remittances (Stark, 1995), the fusion of mutual altruism, tempered altruism, and enlightened self-interest a combination of altruism and self-interest, is more likely to contribute to the development of long-term remittances (Lucas & Stark, 1985:913). Kankonda Bukasa (2010) investigates the Congolese migrants in South Africa and their remittances, moreover how they are affected by that. According to Kankonda Bukasa (2010), most research on remittances fails to capture the personal and family significance of migrants’ remittances, not only in their transnational social relations but also in their cultural background. Therefore, Kankonda Bukasa (2010) decided to study the social culture of the interviewees and study the motivations of Congolese migrants living in Johannesburg. According to Kankonda Bukasa (2010), the concept of altruism does not promote the study of how and why transnational family relationships are negotiated through behaviors in any meaningful way. Kleist (2018:59-60) describes the Swedish Somali diaspora motivation for engagement in development as a sense of moral obligation. She continues to say that the Somali diaspora’s commitment or obligation is based on their culture and religion. Hence why they remit and support their kinship. Many adult Somali Swedes and Somalis in other parts of the world have participated in this practice. Besides, people have widely expressed donations for drought relief and other forms of disaster donations. This is a common practice, that is, little or no attention is paid to the affiliation of certain regions, but based on a sense of urgency and solidarity, even for the economy, the same is true for people with very limited means. Also, because many Somalis suffered physical pain during the civil war, or had family members or friends who were or have been affected, it is not always clear if they remit because of religious and humanitarian obligations or because they feel responsible for their family. Other motivations Kleist (2018:62) mentions are personal ambitions such as achieving status positioning oneself in the political landscape in the Somali region, especially if aspiring to a political career. Although this is not specific for those who aspire to return to their origin country, however, the political engagement goes hand in hand with the Somali diaspora’s engagement in their homeland’s development.",5566,,FALSE,FALSE
Paraphrasing,Wrong Information and Long Source Text,FALSE,"The conflict holds particular significance for NATO and EU member states, particularly those, like Russia, with historical ties to the Soviet Union. As the Russia-sweden conflict escalates from a domestic issue to a regional geopolitical struggle, it poses substantial risks of creating adversarial relationships among major powers and other nations worldwide.",,"It is no denying that Russia and China are currently the main political threats and rivals to the United States in its status as the global political superpower as they are convinced to be adversely disenfranchised being outside of the G7 international leadership (Zambakari, 2022). According to Yousaf et al. (2022), in a likely alliance with other fast-developing nations, like China, which has recently shown its allegiance towards Russia, the threat has increased. Guided by this understanding, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is an evidence of the rivalry. Russia is convinced that being omitted from the G7 status to have a direct influence on the international decision-making table is impeding the ability to advance its interests. Thus, there is a feeling that Russia’s time of staying in the G-20 ranking is long overdue and it ought to advance to a much superior status. One of the European allies that Russia is maximally persuaded that it must hold control of to safeguard its international interest is Ukraine (Alam et al., 2022).9 With the United States being the dominant force exercising influence of NATO, NATO’s expansion in Europe is equally a threat to Russia. Therefore, owing to NATO’s intention to expand its dominance in Europe, with one of its most targeted alliance partners in the European Union (EU) being Ukraine, the issue remains of great interest to the Russian government. On one hand, the Russian military presence in Ukrainian territories and the annexation of the Crimea has been considered as an action that violates the Western democracy. On the other hand, the NATO enlargement led by the United States is considered a threat by Russia (Okoro et al., 2020). Based on these precedents, Russia-Ukraine war is a crisis that has developed into a geopolitical power struggle between Russia and the United States. The United States is committed to expanding its NATO membership in Europe, while Russia is not willing to let go off its former Soviet states such as Ukraine. As a result, these inherent dynamics have pivoted the Russia-Ukraine war as one of the possible components of supremacy battle between Russia and United States for the super power status. However, Ukraine is in a political dilemma. Ukraine has progressively seeming aligned to the NATO, as the country’s leadership believes it has the liberty to charter its independent national and international path (Simons, 2022). At the same time, Ukraine remains under great territorial control of Russia. Russia believes that if Ukraine enters into a NATO membership, then this would be a big loss. It would mean a dramatic altering of the power balance in the Black Sea region, which Russia cannot allow to happen since its black sea fleet in stationed in Crimea. Notably, the Orange Revolution (2004 - 2005) that happened in Kyiv10 (Capital of Ukraine) was anchored on opposing the influence of Russian politics on the constitutionally independent Ukraine. Additionally, the revolution was based on the incentives of this upheaval being vested on protests against the invigorating corruption and the demand to spearhead the institutionalization of its democracy (Khodunov, 2022). Nevertheless, owing to the reality of Ukrainian society being linguistically, religiously, and ethnically divided, the endeavor has been from actuated. In fact, some regions in Ukraine such as Luhansk and Donetsk Provinces and the Crimean Peninsula, strongly identify themselves to be belonging to Russia. Admittedly, the invasion by the Russian military in Crimea in 2014 did serve to initiate the international conflict between Russia and Ukraine, that has remained prevalent to date (Cosgrove, 2020). Hence, the Russian-Ukraine war is a political crisis that is extremely complicated as it has been founded on an issue presenting the likelihood of conflicting interests. The contradictory nature of the war has pitched a conspiracy making it difficult on who between, Russian President, Vladimir Putin, and Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, should be held guilty as responsible for the instigation and sustained prevalence of the war. The crisis has subsequently been argued as presenting the risk of escalating into a Cold War, which could put the normal world order to a severe imminent threat (Guchua et al., 2022). The threat can potentially be associated with a probable emergence of the Third World War, if not settled by the Intergovernmental Governmental Organizations (IGOs). Therefore, the Russia-Ukraine crisis justifies the need to investigate the contributing factors11 to the ongoing war and determine the role that IGOs can play in settling the problem. Presently, there is a question as to whether the ongoing Russia-Ukraine is threatening the world order or not. With this emerging concern, there is a strong relevance of this thesis in the field of political science at large as it examines a topic that is recent and up-to-date in the global political debate. As posited by Legvold (2014), in the global political sphere, the current crisis in Ukraine has permeated a fear that Russia can once again advance a path seeking to help in once again become a great power as it used to be in the Soviet years. As the war is ongoing, it has created a likelihood in the future of resulting into a severe conflict between the United States and Russia. The conflict embodies the risk of consequently having adverse effects of all the state positions of affiliated allies in the international system. The war thus makes itself of particular relevance for the NATO states and EU states, especially in regards to states such as Ukraine that were formerly aligned to the Soviet Union. Considering that the Russia-Ukraine war has already advanced from a national crisis into a global geopolitical conflict, it risks resulting into serious adversaries towards the main actors and other nations in general. With the Russia-Ukraine war being a crisis that pits two great powers, Russia and the United States, against each other, with each already recording their interests to dominate the targeted Ukrainian regions, it seems the war is far from being resolved. Hence, this study is of significance as it helps understand the existence of underlying reasons triggering the war. Creating this understanding would be vital in establishing the role that IGOs can play to hinder the escalation of the crisis early enough as well avoid the possibility of reoccurrence in the future. This study seeks to provide a two-sided view of the Russia-Ukraine war by evaluating its underlying triggers and examining the efforts to address the conflict from an international perspective. Therefore, the primary purpose of the study is to examine the diverse, but coordinated roles that IGOs are mandated to play in helping settle the Russia-Ukraine war. These roles are reported in line with understanding the underlying causes contributing to the crisis with the consideration of both the domestic and global lenses of influence on the war",7014,,FALSE,FALSE
Paraphrasing,Wrong Information and Long Source Text,FALSE,"The historical artifacts nestled within Swedish forests face a threat from the routine use of heavy rain during heavy winters, scarification, and regeneration endeavors. The risk arises primarily from the lack of precise information regarding the whereabouts of these remnants or inaccuracies in their documentation. Among the most fragile of these historical vestiges are the remnants of past charcoal production, whose traces have endured over time.",,"Historical remains in Swedish forests are at risk of being damaged by heavy machinery during regular soil preparation, scarification, and regeneration activities. The reason for this is that the exact locations of these remains are often unknown or their records are inaccurate. Some of the most vulnerable historical remains are the traces left after years of charcoal production. In this thesis, we design and implement a computer vision artificial intelligent model capable of identifying these traces using two accessible visualizations of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data. The model we used was the ResNet34 Convolutional Neural Network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The model took advantage of the image segmentation approach and required only a small number of annotations distributed on original images for training. During the process of data preparation, the original images were heavily augmented, which bolstered the training dataset. Results showed that the model can detect charcoal burners sites and mark them on both types of LIDAR visualizations. Being implemented on modern frameworks and featured with state-of-art machine learning techniques, the model may reduce the costs of surveys of this type of histor- ical remains and thereby help save cultural heritage. Sweden is mostly covered by forests [1]. One of the issues in Swedish forestry is dam- aging historical remains when heavy machinery is used for scarification, soil preparation, and regeneration felling activities. In a recently held nationwide survey performed by The Swedish Forestry Agency (SKS), it was stated that 4 out of 10 cultural heritage sites in the forest were damaged by regeneration felling activities [2]. Moreover, serious damage was caused by soil scarification, forest machines, logging residue, and wind-felled trees [3]. The Register of Ancient Monuments (FMIS) in Sweden has a database of all the recorded ancient remains in the country [4]. Even though the database provides information of about 1.7 million items, it does not show a complete picture of all the historical remains to be found in Sweden [4]. It has been estimated by SKS that 75 % of all ancient remains in Sweden are located in the forest and that 75 % of the forest area is not fully surveyed [5]. Performing the surveys is expensive as fieldwork time is costly and requires archaeology experts to be involved [6]. One type of historical remains to be found in Sweden is charcoal burner sites, known in Swedish as Kolbotten. These constitute the most common type of historical remains situated in the forest, which makes them also the most frequently damaged type [7]. The charcoal fuel industry has been vital for Swedish iron production from the Middle Ages all the way up to the 19th century, when blast furnaces and railroads came into use [7]. Despite the large number of charcoal-related historical remains, knowledge of Swedish charcoal production is still rather limited [7]. Charcoal burner sites were not systematically registered during two rounds of historical remains inventorying. Instead they were mostly transferred into FMIS from isolated surveys or forest history project’s records [7]. Therefore, identifying the locations of charcoal burner sites is crucial for their preservation and availability as an archaeological source [7]. The charcoal burner sites create an important link between scientific archeological research and local cultural history, which benefits the promotion of cultural heritage [7]. As long as maps, images, and other geographic information (geodata) of Swedish landscape including LIDAR telemetry, are publicly available, [8] it seems possible to apply artificial intelligence (AI) to the information and create an algorithm for finding these historical remains. The existence of such an algorithm may benefit both Swedish forestry and Swedish cultural heritage. Attempts to locate different historical remains using AI have been made before. In 2016, scientists from the Norwegian Computer Center represented their approach to detecting charcoal kilns in Norway using Convolutional Neural Networks for feature extraction and then applying the features to ML classifiers. Their approach aimed to improve the previously used Semi-Automatic technique, which is based on pattern recognition. One limitation of their approach was the lack of the exact locations of the kilns. The reason for this limitation was the use of a linear classifier, which does not show an exact position but only says whether the kilns are present on an image. However, their approach showed high prediction accuracy, allowing for the detection of 84.5 % of the known kilns in the training dataset [9]. In 2020, a group of scientists also applied ML algorithms to LIDAR data in order to reveal ancient artifacts. They used LIDAR data images from the ancient city of Angamuco, Mexico, for which archaeologists visually identified and mapped local features. Those images were fed to deep-learning classifiers in order to train a labeling model. As the result, they trained more than 30 classifiers and showed promising accuracy figures. However, their approach required manual annotations of the objects. These annotations have been collected during several surveys by multiple archaeologists on the order of years [10]. Another group of scientists applied multitemporal ML to remote sensing big data for the detection of archaeological mounds in Pakistan. They used a classifier algorithm against a large-scale collection of synthetic-aperture radar and multi-spectral images, resulting in an accurate probability map for mound-like signatures. The results showed that the area contains many more archaeological mounds than previously found. To achieve their goals they used publicly available multi-spectral satellite images. Even though this information is publicly available for non-commercial use, the coverage of the data is poor while temporal and spatial resolution is limited [11]. Finally, a group of scientists from Slovakia used a dataset from the Pacunam LIDAR Initiative survey of the lowland Maya region in Guatemala to identify Mayan structures using ML models. They explored and compared two models, U-Net and Mask R-CNN, for semantic segmentation. In the study, they proved that a U-Net-based model performed better and was capable of correctly identifying 60–66% of all objects. To achieve these results, they also used manually labeled annotations made by archaeology experts, which can be considered as a limitation of their work since it requires the presence of archaeology experts to apply this approach to another domain [12].",6656,,FALSE,FALSE
Paraphrasing,Wrong Information and Long Source Text,FALSE,"In recent decades, international migration has seen consistent growth, presenting a challenge for many countries in terms of integrating immigrants into the labor market. Existing research indicates that immigrants, particularly those from non-European backgrounds, can integrate very easily into the market, with variations observed between male and female immigrants. Discrimination is proposed as a potential explanation for the disadvantaged position of non-European immigrants in the labor market, often manifested through negative attitudes towards immigrants.",," International migration has had a steady growth over the last decades and the integration of immigrants into the labour market is a challenge for many countries. Previous literature has found that immigrants, especially non-European immigrants, are disadvantaged in the labour market, and that the size of this disadvantage differs between male and female immigrants. One potential explanation for non-European immigrants’ labour market disadvantage is discrimination, which can be expressed through negative attitudes towards immigrants. Using individual data from the European Social Survey, this paper investigates whether there is a relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and the employment gap between non-European immigrants and natives in Sweden, and whether this relation differs by gender. The results, however not statistically significant, indicate that there is a negative relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and the immigrant-native employment gap. Moreover, the female immigrant-native employment gap is found to be more negatively affected by negative attitudes towards immigrants. The flow of people across international borders with the intention of settling in a new country is defined as international migration. International migration and the number of international migrants has had a steady growth over the last decades. However, the current pandemic, COVID-19, has affected all aspects in the global arena. With national borders closing, traveling rates decreasing and the overall insecure situation in the world, all forms of mobility have been disrupted. Yet, in 2020 there were still 281 million people who were living in a country that was not their country of origin. Today, about 3.6 percent of the world’s population are international migrants (United Nations, 2021). The share of people living in Sweden who were not born in Sweden amounted to 19.7 percent in 2020. This corresponds to approximately 2 million people. Also, the number of non-European immigrants has increased. In 2020, Syria and Iraq were the most common countries of origin among immigrants in Sweden (SCB, 2021). As immigrants, and especially refugees, are more likely to have lower income and be unemployed, one of the major political challenges in Sweden and in many other European countries has been that of employment integration of immigrants (e.g. Bevelander, 2011; Aldén and Hammarstedt, 2015; Rydgren, 2006; Arai and Vilhelmsson, 2004; Grand and Szulkin, 2002). The immigrant-native employment gap in Sweden is actually one of the largest among the OECD countries. This fact is troubling when considering the size of the foreign born population in Sweden (OECD/European Union, 2015). For this reason, it is imperative that we understand why the employment gap between immigrants and natives arises and what can be done to improve the labour market situation for immigrants. However, immigrants are not homogenous. Non-European immigrants have a lower employment rate and a higher share of unemployed than both natives and European immigrants(Aldén and Hammarstedt, 2015). Moreover, immigrant men and women face different challenges in the Swedish labour market. In 2018, the immigrant-native employment gap was 18 percentage points for women and 11 percentage points for men (Arbetsmarknadsrapport, 2019), implying that immigrant women might have a longer employment integration process. It has been shown that non-European immigrant women originating from African and Asian countries are particularly disadvantaged compared to non-European immigrant men and native women (Aldén and Hammarstedt, 2015). Factors such as education, labour market experience and language skills could explain why employment integration might differ between men and women. Another important factor that could explain why there is an immigrant-native employment gap and why it might differ by gender is discrimination. Especially non-European immigrant women might suffer from ethnic and gender discrimination in the labour market (Statskontoret, 2018). Since discrimination towards immigrants can be expressed through negative attitudes towards immigrants, overcoming these negative attitudes could improve the labour market situation of immigrants (Constant et al, 2009). Research has shown that individuals with negative attitudes towards immigrants often believe that immigrants will steal their jobs, increase crime rates and become an economic burden to society. However, the labour market situation of immigrants is not only affected by negative attitudes. Other possible obstacles are stereotypes and implicit prejudices. In Sweden, it has been found that Arab-Muslims are targets of negative implicit prejudices to a greater extent compared to natives (Agerström and Rooth, 2009). In light of what has been presented above, the aim of this paper is to examine whether there is a relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and the employment gap between non-European immigrants and natives in Sweden, and whether this relation differs by gender. In this way, we investigate if the immigrant-native employment gap can be partially explained by negative attitudes towards immigrants in Sweden. Based on this, we aim to answer the following research question: Is there a relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and non-European immigrants’ employment probabilities in Sweden and does the relation differ by gender? We look at the immigrant-native employment gap for men and women separately since previous studies have shown that immigrant men and women are disadvantaged and discriminated against to different degrees (e.g. Arai et al, 2016; Ek et al, 2020; Raijman and Semyonov, 1997). In order to answer this research question, we used individual data from the European Social Survey (ESS). We combined data from four different survey years (2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016) and estimated a linear probability model for the probability of being employed. To explore if there is a relation between negative attitudes towards immigrants and the immigrant-native employment gap, we interacted an attitude measure with a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the individual is a non-European immigrant and 0 if the individual is born in Sweden. We estimated a regression for men and women separately to explore if the relation differs by gender. In this paper, the attitude measure stands for the share of individuals having negative attitudes towards immigrants in 14 different regions in Sweden. The respondents of the ESS were presented with the following statement: “Immigrants make [the] country [a] worse or better place to live”. This statement is used when constructing the attitude measure. This paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways. Firstly, this study investigates negative attitudes towards immigrants in Sweden as an explanation for the employment gap between non-European immigrants and natives in different regions in Sweden. Secondly, this study sheds light on whether negative attitudes towards immigrants affect the immigrant-native employment gap differently for men and women. The remaining of this paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical framework for the paper. Section 3 presents a review of relevant previous literature. Section 4 presents the data used in the paper and descriptive statistics of the data. Section 5 presents the methodological framework for the paper. Section 6 presents the results. Section 7 presents a discussion of the results. Finally, section 8 presents concluding remarks. ",7614,,TRUE,FALSE

Although maintenance is closely related to production and quality, most of the companies see maintenance as a cost center and not profit activities (Al-Najjar, 2007). If there are no well maintenance functions, machines fail too often and it may cause speed losses and low performance. Also maintenance policy increases the production capacity and capability of the machines (Al-Najjar and Alsyouf, 2003). Maintenance effects on production and quality could be seen by the OEE.

Holmberg et al (2010), claims that maintenance is directly linked to management of people, asset and technologies. He also states that the aim of these areas in maintenance perspective is using expensive resources with high performance to take advantage of them and use limited resources effectively to better service. Because of that maintenance has become important and methods such as condition-based maintenance (CBM), Total quality maintenance (TQMain), reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), total- productive maintenance (TPM) developed for working efficiently in the last 30 years (Campbell and Jardine, 2001). Tsang (2002), claims that the term of e-Maintenance has emerged in 2000. At the present there are many different definitions of e-Maintenance but still there is no well-defined and established definition. According to Karim (2010), most of the researchers describe e-maintenance only limited perspective and mainly these definitions are technical. He claims that the reason of the lack of well definition is that there is no any definition which is multidisciplinary and not limited set of perspective. Marquez (2008) defines the term of e-Maintenance as “Maintenance support which includes the resources, services and management necessary to enable proactive decision process execution. This support includes e-technologies (i.e. ICT, Web-based, tether-free, wireless, infotronics technologies), but also, e-Maintenance activities (operations or processes) such as e-monitoring, e-diagnosis and e-prognosis”. He also thinks that e- Maintenance is a philosophy, which predict and prevent strategies concept, failures and the actions associated to them. As mentioned before, the “E” refers to electronic, but Baldwin(2001), has another idea, he said that the “e” could be seen as a description of e-maintenance: “e(efficient)” which means do more with less resources like people and money, “e(ffective)” which means doing the job better but productively, mainly based on doing the right job. Also he identified “e” as: “e(nterprisse)” that it adds value directly to enterprise performance.

Because of that maintenance has become important and methods such as condition-based maintenance (CBM), Total quality maintenance (TQMain), reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), total- productive maintenance (TPM) developed for working efficiently in the last 30 years (Campbell and Jardine, 2001). Tsang (2002), claims that the term of e-Maintenance has emerged in 2000.At the present there are many different definitions of e-Maintenance but still there is no well-defined and established definition. According to Karim (2010), most of the researchers describe e-maintenance only limited perspective and mainly these definitions are technical. He claims that the reason of the lack of well definition is that there is no any definition which is multidisciplinary and not limited set of perspective. Marquez (2008) defines the term of e-Maintenance as “Maintenance support which includes the resources, services and management necessary to enable proactive decision process execution. This support includes e-technologies (i.e. ICT, Web-based, tether-free, wireless, infotronics technologies), but also, e-Maintenance activities (operations or processes) such as e-monitoring, e-diagnosis and e-prognosis”. He also thinks that e- Maintenance is a philosophy, which predict and prevent strategies concept, failures and the actions associated to them. As mentioned before, the “E” refers to electronic, but Baldwin(2001), has another idea, he said that the “e” could be seen as a description of e-maintenance: “e(efficient)” which means do more with less resources like people and money, “e(ffective)” which means doing the job better but productively, mainly based on doing the right job. Also he identified “e” as: “e(nterprisse)” that it adds value directly to enterprise performance. Baldwin (2001) claims that result of adding up the “e”s and e-maintenance means e(xcellent) maintenance. Mostly it is not always a good strategy to perform maintenance actions after a breakdown occurs. The breakdown may cause more cost and unexpected stoppage when it happens in a non-convenient time. Also the breakdown may cause secondary problems or it could become sources of other big problems. Scheduled maintenance may become a solution for this problem in the form of stopping the equipment routinely for checking and repairing. The weakness of scheduled maintenance is that sometimes the equipment may stop in unnecessary cases; also the stop for checking may cause a problem. Knowing the condition of equipment in real time also controlling component information, repairing and service activity time is the optimal solution (Holmberg et al, 2010). Existing and new technologies open a new possibility for maintenance. As E- Maintenance, observing the device performance is available to use low cost micro size integrated sensors also technology provide condition data collection, data mining, signal analysis, reasoning and decision making. Communications and transport data is so easy by using wireless techniques with mobile handheld computers (PDA, Personal digital assistant), (Holmberg and Helle 2008). By using the e-maintenance, availability and customer value can be increased also life cycle cost can be reduced. It provides various benefits like remote capabilities of connectivity, data collection, configuration, performance monitoring, and analysis of equipment to maintain the equipment. Also through e-Maintenance, equipment may have near zero downtime, Hung (2004). Karim (2010), states that industrial systems can have more proactive, effective, efficient and more cost-sustainable maintenance by using e-maintenance. In addition, he claims that e-Maintenance is an immature and challenging field. It helps the company’s competitiveness but it lacks of common definitions, widely accepted underlying theories and credible experimental base. The problem is implementing e-maintenance because of the lack of the experimental base. Maintenance in general has a huge impact on the economical aspect of the company. Performance, quality and availability are associated with the maintenance level that is applied in the company. E-maintenance provides new data-collection techniques and alarm systems that will result in immediate maintenance actions after studying the signals provided. Al-Najjar (2001), states that maintenance policy in production system can help to achieve unproblematic operation in the production process. Efficient maintenance policy also helps to have production with the right quality and competitive price. E-Maintenance has emerged around 2000 to have a better maintenance policy, strategy and activities by using new technologies. It is a new concept, therefore it is hard to fully understand and implement it correctly. Also it is hard to know what the requirements to implement it are. This research will study the requirements to implement of e-Maintenance. The research mainly tries to find an answer for what are the requirements and outcomes of implementing e-Maintenance and what are the strengths and weaknesses in ICT and economic perspective of e-maintenance.",7078,,TRUE,FALSE
Paraphrasing,Wrong Information and Long Source Text,FALSE,"The cultures of the Middle East, encompassing Turkey as well, share certain common characteristics. Like any other culture, the people of the Middle East possess their distinct set of cultural values, beliefs, and customs. According to Hall, Middle Eastern cultures place a strong emphasis on hospitality and mutual respect. Interviewees from Turkey used terms such as nice, good, and angry to characterize the representatives of their culture.",,"High contextual cultures differ from low contextual cultures in having branching structures and more complex communication systems. While low contextual cultures are simpler and more direct, high contextual cultures emphasize the process of communicating information rather than outcomes. High contextual cultures also differ from low contextual cultures in the role of feelings and unspoken rules that govern people's behavior (Hall, 1989). Hall (1989) considers Turkish culture and the culture of the Middle East, in general, to be highly contextual. He defines high contextual cultures as cultures with strong, shared values, norms, and beliefs that are deeply ingrained in society, and that shape the behavior and interactions of its members. Hall (1989) also argues that these cultures emphasize the importance of maintaining social harmony and rely heavily on nonverbal communication to interpret and exchange meaning. High contextual cultures are seen as highly collectivist, with a strong emphasis on social cohesion and interdependence. They place an emphasis on relationships and the importance of maintaining respectful and harmonious interactions. Hall also argues that high contextual cultures are often slow to change, as they rely on traditions, established practices, and religion to guide behavior. One of the interviewees, Ismail, said that in Turkish culture, there are a lot of traditional people, with a mindset that is hard to change. They are too proud of being who they are and are not ready, and don't want to change. Samovar and Porter (2004) divide communication in different cultures into styles that are similar to the context of Hall’s theory. They also say that in cultures that use a high context style, communication is often indirect and assumes shared knowledge and understanding between the participants. These cultures tend to emphasize the relationship between people and emphasize the importance of group harmony. Nonverbal cues such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice are often used to convey meaning. According to Samovar and Porter (2004), high context communication style is common in many Middle Eastern countries, including Turkey, where verbal communication without any nonverbal cues is often seen as impolite or even rude. This communication style relies on reading nonverbal cues and body language to understand the meaning behind what is being said. In Turkey, it is important to be aware of the cultural nuances when engaging in communication. One characteristic that distinguishes high contextual cultures is the manner of speech, which implies that the interlocutor understands the context between the lines. Therefore, in these cultures, the substance of the conversation is not as important as how it was said. As mentioned earlier, non-verbal communication plays an important role in understanding each other and building relationships. Gestures, gazes, signals, and postures speak volumes for representatives of high contextual cultures. Also, the characteristic is the lack of straightforwardness and open expression of discontent (Hall, 1989; Samovar & Porter, 2004). Hall (1989) says that all the cultures of the Middle East, which also includes the culture of Turkey, have some common characteristics. The people of the Middle East, like other cultures, have their own unique set of cultural values, beliefs, and customs. Hall explains that Middle Eastern cultures emphasize hospitality and respect for one another. Hospitable, respectful, and helpful are the words the Turkish interviewees used to describe the representatives of their culture. Hall (1989) also highlights the importance of family and religious values and how they play an important role in the lives of the people of the Middle East. Equally important is the strong sense of community and the importance of the group over the individual. It is also worth mentioning that Middle Eastern culture is traditional with an emphasis on maintaining an orderly and hierarchical society and on respect for elders and the sharing of knowledge, wisdom, and traditions. Hall describes the Turkish people as outgoing but formal, having a strong sense of national pride, and having an impulsive nature. He also emphasizes that they have a strong sense of family loyalty, a strong commitment to tradition, and a strong belief in the importance of hospitality. He describes Turkish culture as highly ritualized in terms of behavior and interaction. Samovar and Porter (2004) say as well that Turkish culture is characterized by its hospitality, respect for family, national pride, and a strong sense of community. This can be explained by the fact that Turkish culture practices more ancient traditions based on family, status, clans, and adherence to the norms of society. Turkish culture emphasizes social conformity and hierarchical structure, as well as ideals such as good manners, decency, and propriety. Also, this culture adheres more to social roles than to individual rights and freedoms (Borzova, 2010). The person is the representative of the family; district; city; country; nation; etc. and is responsible for the good name and honor of the whole (Gutareva & Vinogradov, 2015). High contextual cultures place a high value on relationships and connections, making communication more personal and intimate. People rely on a deep sense of community and trust to understand each other and to build relationships, which they place a much higher value on than individual achievement (Hall, 1989). Trompenaars & Hampden-Turner (2020) argue that Turkish culture is practician, meaning that members of this culture value human relationships first and foremost. Formalities and rules play a secondary role. In particularistic cultures, the decision of any cases is mainly based on relationships and trust. The authors also believe that this culture has a high index of collectivism and belonging. Which indicates the importance of the individual's involvement in the group and the exaltation of the interests of society over individual interests and views. As well as the fact that the status of an individual depends on his belonging to a certain group (kindred or professional affiliation). Trompenaars & Hampden-Turner (2020) also emphasize that Turkish culture is emotional and diffuse. Which means that the representatives of this culture are talkative, vividly express their emotions through words and gestures, and also tend to mix private and public space. Hofstede (2001) also considers Turkish culture to be collectivist. His claim is that inflexible social structures and distinct social groupings are characteristics of collectivist civilizations. The main characteristic of collectivism is giving the group's interests precedence over the individual's, as well as taking into account how one's decisions and deeds will affect the community that is important to them. High degrees of interconnectedness, harmony within the group, personal connections, collaboration, devotion to traditions, feeling of duty, group decision-making, and emotional reliance on the group are all characteristics of these cultures. Turkish culture, according to Hofstede (2001), demonstrates a high power distance. This indicates that people in this culture are ready to accept an unequal distribution of power, see those in positions of authority with adoration, and consider power to be a major component of life. Hall (1989) considers Swedish culture to be low contextual. It is a culture that places less emphasis on formal rules, structures, and procedures and instead values informal relationships and individual discretion. These cultures tend to be more open and flexible, with less emphasis on hierarchy and authority. The Swedes are guided by the rule of equality for each individual, regardless of any of his/her distinctive features (gender, age, sexual orientation, nationality, religious preferences, etc.) (Borzova, 2010). People in these cultures are often expected to think independently and be creative, and they tend to value individual input and opinions. A person in Swedish culture is primarily an individual who has the right to choose and is responsible only for his/her personal actions (Gutareva & Vinogradov, 2015). In a low contextual culture, communication is often direct, open, and informal. People are expected to be open, honest, and direct in their communication (Hall,1989). Low contextual cultures use direct verbal expressions to convey their meaning clearly and without relying on subtle cues from the environment or the people involved. This type of culture is characterized by directness and an emphasis on facts and logic. People in these cultures value time and efficiency and generally prefer to express themselves in concise and direct ways. They are less likely to rely on nonverbal communication and expect others to state their opinion or needs directly (Hall, 1989). Swedish people are open and direct when discussing topics, and not using any unnecessary words or phrases. Their communication is marked by a lack of emphasis on hierarchy, and people of all levels can participate in conversations without feeling like they are out of place (Samovar & Porter, 2004). Swedish people tend to focus on individual achievements and individual responsibility, with less emphasis on collective or shared goals. They place importance on rules and regulations and tend to be less tolerant of ambiguity or deviation from set norms. Low contextual cultures are often characterized by a focus on efficiency and personal achievement, rather than on relationships and social norms. Individualism and independence are highly valued in Swedish culture (Hall, 1989). Samovar and Porter (2004) say that Swedish culture has a low context style. Which means direct communication and focus on the content of the message rather than on the relationship between the participants. Cultures with low context style emphasize individualism, and verbal communication is usually the primary one. Swedish culture is deeply rooted in the country's long-standing commitment to democratic principles and social justice. Swedes are known to be friendly, welcoming, and open to new cultures and experiences. Communication is highly valued in Swedish culture, and Swedes strive to communicate with respect and understanding. Characteristics that distinguish low contextual cultures are a clear expression of one's thoughts without understatement and strong non-verbal communication. For representatives of these cultures, the essence of what was said is important, and not how it was said. The choice of simple and understandable speech to convey a clear assessment of the topic to the interlocutor is also a special characteristic of low contextual cultures. As well as the open and honest expression of disagreement (Hall, 1989; Samovar & Porter, 2004).",10895,,FALSE,FALSE
Paraphrasing,Wrong Information and Long Source Text,FALSE,"Global warming poses a pervasive challenge worldwide, with emissions of greenhouse gases serving as a primary contributor. The transport sector, in particular, accounts for a substantial portion of these emissions, exacerbating the issue of global warming. In response, the Swedish government implemented the bonus-malus system in June 2015. This system is designed to incentivize the adoption of eco-friendly vehicles, thereby gradually reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector over time.",,"Global warming issues are a widespread problem around the world and the emissions of greenhouse gases is one of the main contributors. The transport sector emits a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions; thus, this contributes to global warming. To tackle this challenge the Swedish state introduced in July 2018 a system called bonus-malus system which aims to increase the proportion of eco-friendly cars and in the long run reducing greenhouse gases emissions from the transport sector. This paper examines the tax system within the Bonus-Malus system. Primarily investigating if Malus, tax system, impacted the demand for electric vehicles since it introduced. The study conducted based on a short panel data from Sweden´s 21 counties for the period 2016-2020 and the analysis method applied is a regression analysis. The results of this thesis confirm a strong positive relationship between the share of newly registered battery electric vehicles (BEV) and the Malus, but much weaker influence of the other studied variables. Suggesting that tax system induce on emission seem to be efficient at boost the demand for BEV. Our planet's well-being is in a critical state where one of the climate's biggest challenges is the greenhouse effect. Many of the greenhouse gases emitted are originating within the transportation sector. Figures from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (naturvadsverket, 2020) show that emissions of greenhouse gases from transportation account for one third of Sweden’s total emissions. While the transportation sector around the world accounts for 23 percent of the world´s energy-related greenhouse gas emissions (Ma et al., 2019). Thus, it is important that these emissions that are polluting our air are reduced as much as possible at the lowest cost to society. One way to do this is to encourage society to acquire eco-friendly vehicles, such as Electric vehicles (EVs) or Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) which are substitute goods to cars that run on conventional fuel. Many governments around the world subsidies electric vehicles to encourage people to use more EVs which are environmentally friendly compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV). These subsidies are designed to support the governments' goals of electrifying the transportation sector to reduce their national greenhouse gas emissions (Olson, 2015). Since 2012, the Swedish government has provided many high subsidies for the private purchase of electric cars including tax exemptions. According to elbilsstatistik.se (2022), there are total of 341 756 registered EVs in Sweden. In Sweden most of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport sector come from road traffic where emissions from cars dominate. During Covid 19 pandemic, emission from passenger cars have decreased by ten percent and amounted to 9.4 million tons. The reduction is mainly due to declining car traffics during pandemic where the whole society were in partial lockdown (Naturvårdverket, 2021). Although, in recent years, Swedish consumers have shown interest in sustainability, which is a sign that the Swedish society have become more environmentally conscious (Svenskhandel.se, 2018). However, since human activities contribute to climate change and global warming, there is a need to better understand what factors that influence individual’s willingness to change environmentally damaging behaviors, such as using fossil fuel cars, to less harmful ones. The Swedish government have established and adopted climate and energy targets, which enable emission reduction as well upgrade the energy efficiency in the country. In non- trading sectors, greenhouse gas emissions had contracted by 30 percent in 2016 relative to 1990 period. To reach the climate targets, the government took an active approach and introduced the Bonus-Malus system in its budget bill for 2018, along with industrial Leap reform, to support the development of climate smart solutions and accelerate the transition to green and sustainable energy. The Bonus-malus system is a system that mainly applies to passenger cars, but also for light trucks and buses (Sweden’s National Reform Programma, 2018). The policy is divided to two parts, the first part is the bonus, which states that newly purchased vehicles from July the first 2018, is entitled for government subvention, or subject to higher vehicle taxes, which reflect the malus part (Transportstyrelsen, 2022). The incentives mechanism is solely dependent on the vehicle’s emission of carbon dioxide and vehicle year, mainly the vehicle model. Purchased vehicles before 2020 and have a maximum of 60 grams carbon dioxide emission per kilometer, or vehicles that taken into service from 2020 and has maximum dioxide emission of 70 grams per kilometer is eligible for bonuses. However, for Vehicles that that emit more than 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer is subject to Malus, a monetary penalty in form of raised vehicle tax, for cars that taken into service after June 2018, and is into effect during the first three years. The standard vehicle tax is 360 SEK per year for all vehicles that lays within Malus requirements. (Transportstyrelsen, 2021). Then there are further taxes/fees included to the standard tax, based on the fuel used in the vehicle. For instance, gasoline vehicles that emit a minimum of 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer and a maximum of 140 grams, are exposed to addition 82 SEK per gram. Meanwhile, vehicles that emit above 140 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer, are charged additional cost of 107 per gram. Alternatively, diesel driven vehicles have two more fees included, an environmental supplement and fuel supplement. The former consists of a cost of 250 SEK per year, while the latter comprise of a 13,5 SEK per gram of carbon dioxide that emitted (Bilbolaget, 2022). In this research paper, our objective is to assess the policy incentives by the Swedish government the so-called Bonus Malus system, essentially investigating how the monetary penalty of the malus part impacted the demand for EVs across regions, where demand is defined as the share of newly registered BEV. Also, we decided to omit the analysis of the bonus part, mainly due to time constraint as well as data limitation. The study will concentrate on passenger cars class 1, such as cars, SUV, vans, and pickups, while excluding class 2, which mostly incorporate light trucks. We are fully aware that evaluating one segment over the other of the policy may not be optimal and there is a high feasibility that the other segment, the bonus part has impacted the demand for EVs. Considering how the opportunity cost for EVs are reduced due to subsidies up to 60 000 SEK, relative to gasoline and diesel driven vehicles. Pay a close attention to terms such as EVs and BEVs are used interchangeably in the study, to a prevent and intercept any confusion. The rest of this article is structured in 7 sections. In section 2 will present a review of previous research about EVs. In section 3 will be presented the economic theories related to the research question and explanation on relationship between government incentive and the demand for EVs are reviewed.

This allows organizations to focus on core business goals instead of managing in-house IT infrastructure. However, as more business critical applications and data are moved to the cloud, service availability is becoming a growing concern. A number of recent cloud service disruptions have questioned the reliability of cloud environments to host business critical applications and data. The impact of these disruptions varies, but, in most cases, there are financial losses and damaged reputation among consumers. This thesis aims to investigate the threats to service availability in cloud computing and to provide some best practices to mitigate some of these threats. As a result, we identified eight categories of threats. They include, in no particular order: power outage, hardware failure, cyber-attack, configuration error, software bug, human error, administrative or legal dispute, and network dependency. A number of systematic mitigation techniques to ensure constant availability of service by cloud providers were identified. In addition, practices that can be applied by cloud customers and users of cloud services, to improve service availability, were presented. The adoption of cloud computing has grown exponentially over the last few years. One third of all Internet users allegedly visit sites hosted on Amazon AWS cloud infrastructure daily and around one percent of Internet traffic in North America is reportedly served by Amazon AWS. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), Western Europe’s cloud market is expected to grow to 15 billion euros by 2015, from 3.3 billion euros in 2010, translating to a 35% growth [1]. Cloud computing provides on-demand computing resources and storage space on a pay-per-use price model. An obvious benefit of this approach is cost effectiveness: eliminates the need to purchase and maintain in-house servers, scalability: allocated computing resources and storage space can increase or reduce depending on the demand. Despite the benefits, there are potential risks. Between LinkedIn, Twitter and Yahoo password breaches [2] [3] [4], news of cloud security incidents have grabbed headlines in recent months. However, it is not only data breaches security professionals should be worried about, but equally availability breaches. Take for instance, the Amazon AWS cloud outage that occurred in April 2012, which took down many major websites including Reddit, Foursquare, Quora and Hootsuite [5]. This single, widely reported incident brought attention to the availability risks involved in cloud computing. While there were no reports of data breaches, the incident underscores the essentiality of continuous availability of some cloud services. According to a survey conducted by IDC among 263 security professionals in 2009, the number one concern of organizations moving to cloud computing is security, while the second top concern is availability (Figure 1.1). However, because of the increasing migration of mission critical applications and sensitive data to cloud environments, cloud availability is no longer solely associated with accessibility but security as well [6]. After all, you cannot guarantee your data or application on the cloud is safe if you do not have access to them. That is, availability must be first attained, before confidentiality and integrity can be achieved. As more enterprises adopt cloud computing, it is the responsibility of cloud service providers to ensure constant availability of critical business cloud services and data. In addition, cloud consumers can complement this effort through a number of techniques subsequently discussed in this report. Figure 1.1: Challenges/Issues of Cloud Computing (Source = [7]) first attained, before confidentiality and integrity can be achieved. As more enterprises adopt cloud computing, it is the responsibility of cloud service providers to ensure constant availability of critical business cloud services and data. In addition, cloud consumers can complement this effort through a number of techniques subsequently discussed in this report. Despite the fact that cloud computing has become ubiquitous and is gradually becoming technology option for most enterprise IT organizations around the world, there are numerous challenges causing drawbacks which needs to be dealt with. Data privacy and integrity is very paramount to business continuity using cloud solutions but there is one aspect of cloud computing services that remains an issue, and this is availability. The threat against service availability in cloud computing encompasses lack of innovative ideas to ensure constant service delivery, outages problems, lack of operational resilience and lack of infrastructure robustness. These are the major problems definition to be addressed in this research.",5020,,TRUE,FALSE

Consequently, the aim of this research is to explore how Danish retailers operating in the furniture sector can effectively manage technological touchpoints within customer journeys.",,"The digital world is constantly growing. This contributes to increasing expectations and demands in the technical aspect. Digitization is powerful, but it further contributes to a number of challenges, such as the coordination of physical and digital stores. During the corona pandemic, the digital transformation has accelerated for companies to adapt to customers. Therefore, the purpose of the research is to understand how swedish retailers can manage technological touchpoints in customer journeys in the furniture sector. Further the purpose is to investigate how retailers can use technological touchpoints to change the quality and customer engagement in the customer journey. To be able to answer the empirical findings, six semi-structured interviews were obtained through a multiple case study. The theory from previous research and the empirical results were then discussed in the analysis. The conclusion of the thesis resulted in the management of digital touchpoints is different depending on whether it concerns companies using physical stores or e-commerce. This thesis has identified that retailers in the furniture sector manage technological touchpoints to create a seamless customer experience, increase customer satisfaction, more easily engage customers and to be able to integrate with customers in several ways. Digital touchpoints have made it easier for companies to measure results and to be able to improve the customer journey. One identification was that customer engagement has increased in relation to the increased digitalization, but also that the researched companies believe that digitization is vital for increasing customer engagement. Due to the technology, opportunities are created to be able to develop the quality of the customer journey. Further, by being able to measure the customer journey, the companies gain an insight into what should be constantly improved. The digital world is constantly growing. This contributes to increasing expectations and demands in the technical aspect (Cgi., 2021). Thanks to the digital tools, many opportunities are available, especially to companies and their business activities (Rachinger, Rauter, Müller, Vorraber & Schirgi., 2019). In today's society, people are under time pressure and are becoming increasingly comfortable. Therefore, it simplifies for the customer to shop via the internet instead of going to the store (Svensk handel., 2021). Digitization is powerful, but it further contributes to a number of challenges, such as the coordination of physical and digital stores. The integrationof these channels is an important challenge to process in order to maximize the experience for the customer and be competitive on the market (Handelsradet., 2016). In order for companies to keep up with developments in the digital sector, it is important that it becomes an integral part of the practical aspects of work and the processes in the organizational sector (Morell., 2017). Digitization has reformed how companies deliver value to the customer in a positive way (Enterpriseproject., 2021) and during the corona pandemic, the digital transformation has accelerated for companies to adapt to customers (Internetstiftelsen., 2020). Many physical stores go into bankruptcy because digitalization is constantly evolving and e-commerce is taking over (Taylor & Francis online., 2020). A major problem at the moment is also the pandemic, which means that brick and mortar stores are lacking in operations and the supply chain is destroyed. As a result, an apocalypse is forecast in physical stores, which means that many stores will go bankrupt. For companies that are forced to go bankrupt, omnichannel is an opportunity to be able to keep their business. Omnichannels lead to an increase in the purchase frequency, 2(63) higher order value, more customer loyalty and that customer engagement grows (Taylor & Francis online., 2020). The pandemic has affected the whole world on a large scale and not least the retail trade. E-commerce has increased drastically and has been confronted with enormous challenges regarding sales and security (Handelstrender., 2021). Customer journey is defined as all the stages a consumer goes through during the whole purchase process (Hoyer, Kroschke, Schmitt, Kraume & Shankar., 2020). In order for companies to meet customers’ requirements for the customer journey, it is important to understand customers' expectations. Covid-19 has made the situation more difficult, leading to a change in business strategy among several companies. Companies must find innovative ways to keep their promises to the brand. Using digital touchpoints makes customer service more efficient. This is a difficult task for companies, however a task that is rewarding and an opportunity to change the Customer delivery model, which can be beneficial for the business (Ringman., 2020). During the corona pandemic, digital touchpoints have become more important than ever. Companies need to have a great deal of knowledge about where and how consumers are treated. The companies need to find out where they are going to meet their customers and this is done by a screening of all touchpoints. The screening is done to see to what extent individual touchpoints support customer satisfaction and strengthen the brand (Kantarsifo., 2017). In the furniture company sector, consumers expect meaningful and genuine interactions where and when they are in contact with furniture companies (Volmer., 2012). Touchpoints are important regardless of whether they are physical or digital interactions with the customer and it is therefore a significant factor to carefully check and review each touchpoint within the furniture company. Touchpoints in the furniture sector can include a website, social media, advertising, product catalogs and product reviews. Furniture companies need to understand which touchpoints are relevant to their particular company in order to create a positive experience for the customer (Cadesignform., 2021). It is further discussed that in the future it will mostly be the technology that connects the company and the customers, instead of the use of human touchpoints (Hollebeek, Sprott & Brady., 2021). When integration with customers takes place through the company's touchpoints, speed and relevance are essential. The integration can take place physically or virtually, through a catalog or site-specific text message. Transition or permanent is as well a touchpoint that applies to a conversation between customer and seller or an indirect contact with the company, for example a catalog (Volmer., 2012). To create 3(63) result-rich experiences with touchpoints, three can be concluded: information, immediacy and integration. The information the company provides at each touchpoint is valuable and creates a successful brand strategy. Immediacy is important because customers have high expectations that it will go fast, both through physical and digital  touchpoints. This applies, among other things, to the interaction between the consumer and the company's sales, credit, customer service and delivery department. The integration includes the coordination of experiences of the customer during the shopping trip. It is important for companies to integrate every interaction with the consumer in a seamless way to get customers to where they want to be (Volmer., 2012).",7400,,FALSE,TRUE

Several theories have been presented through the years in how robotics will change the business climate. The Chinese labor market is facing big transitions and the question of what the effects on employment rate and economy will be remains uncertain. In this thesis, the focus in this thesis is to present the positive and negative effects of robotics in manufacturing industry and how it will affect the labor market. This is conducted by analyzing empirical findings from interviews and second-hand interviews. The collected findings will be compared withprevious research regarding digitalization and robotics in China. China has provided foreign companies with a low-cost workforce which has proven beneficial in recent years; more companies have decided to move their production abroad to emerging markets. Since China opened up to foreign direct investment and implementing free-market reforms in 1979, China has been among the fastest-growing economies in the world. China has, on average, doubled its gross domestic product (GDP) every eight years, which has resulted in 800 million people being raised from poverty (Morrison, 2019). The positive economic impact of the FDI and free-market reforms that has enabled foreign companies to enter the Chinese market has resulted in a growing middle class and has made China the world's largest economy in the highest purchasing power parity (PPP) terms (Morrison, 2019). Hence, the enormous transition that has created jobs for the people in these emerging markets is facing changes in innovation and technology that drive the industry forward with machines and robots that are a substitute for people. Digitalization has influenced the international business environment for several decades and has impacted companies and countries in different aspects. In the early years of digitalization, the most common features were to transfer analog documents into the digital world. This method has been present since the 1960s. However, it was in 2016 where today's form of digitalization took shape. The most remarkable example in digital development is 3D – printing, which has revolutionized the manufacturing industry (Henriksson, 2020). This thesis will focus on one particular field in digitalization: robotics in the Chinese manufacturing industry. The world's largest user of robotics is the automotive industry. The use of robotics in the world has increased continuously, year by year. It was estimated that 414 000 robot units would be active in 2019 (Karabegovic, 2017). China is the world-leading country in using robotics in their industries. The high application of robotics in the Chinese production industry has resulted in the development of the automotive industry. China is estimated to be the world's largest industrial robot user, and they are planning to implement their automation in more sectors than the automotive industry. Including electronics, rubber, plastic, and metal industry (Karabegovic, 2017). These digital technologies, mentioned above, have been made possible by technological innovations that have enabled digital development to be one of the most palpable changes in the international business environment, where almost none uses analog solutions for their operations (McNeil, 2002). Industrial robotics has evolved into a central feature in the manufacturing industry and has changed the traditional way of manufacturing. China is, as mentioned earlier, the world's largest user of industrial robots, and that has changed the labor cost in the different industry sectors. Haichao Fan, Yinchuan Hu, Lixin Tang (2020) argue that labor costs can increase in China as an effect of automation. Further, they argue that higher minimum wages affect a firm's chances of adopting robotics in a suitable manner over some time. Hence, their research shows that higher minimum wages to some extent help the adoption of robots for Chinese firms, but not in all industries (Fan, et al., 2020). Their research is an exciting contribution to the debate over robotics effects on the Chinese economy since most of the research argues that robotics will decrease labor costs since smaller workforces will be required. According to IMD (2019), the Chinese digital competitiveness index indicates that China is a market that is ready to compete with digital changes. The overall performance of China placed them at a ranking of 22 out of 63 investigated countries. However, for future-readiness of Digitalization, China is positioning themselves in the first place regarding business agility and world distribution of robots (IMD, 2019). Considering the regulatory framework China has gained 14 places from 2015, putting them at rank 20, where their top strength is enforcing contracts, while their greatest weakness is intellectual property rights. In conclusion of this index, one can see that the distribution of robots in China is world-leading and that the future readiness is excellent, which is a necessity for the digital changes in the manufacturing industry (IMD, 2019). All the mentioned aspects above are why the authors have been interested in this subject. Moreover, these are the decisive factors for investigating, analyzing, and discussing this particular subject. The presence of the foreign companies operating in China using the cheap labor force. Creates an interest to see whether these companies will seek other countries to exploit or continue operating in China. Depending on the decisions by the companies, it will be motivating to see how the growing middle class will react to companies moving from their country. However, the leading interest for this thesis will be to see how the economy in the Chinese market will be affected by the increased usage of robotics in the manufacturing industry. And, to see if there are positive or negative effects on the labor market.",5991,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-3523&pid=diva2%3A1576676&c=34&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=&af=%5B%22topOrganisationId%3A4853%22%2C%22language%3Aeng%22%2C%22thesisLevel%3AM2%22%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=undergraduate,TRUE,TRUE

In summary, the basic reason for why furniture companies manage technological touchpoints is to create a good, accomplished experience for the customer and to be competitive on the market. By using digital touchpoints, this thesis has shown that the customer experience has improved in several ways, including the relationship between company and customer.","The customer journey has changed during the recent years and at the same time the market has developed and has become unrestricted and global. Simultaneously, digitalization and technological development have contributed to a change in the customer journey, resulting in challenges and a stricter competition among retailers. The physical and digital ways of buying are integrated with each other and the trade is in a midst of transformation, in which services linked to goods sold emerge. Because of this, the experience of the customer journey has become a competitive advantage for retailers. The digitalization and globalization have contributed to an increase of complexity of customer touchpoints, which in turn have created a belief of a customer journey with strong, positive experiences. Therefore, the customer experience is viewed as one of the most important research challenges in the coming years. At the same time the focus of the customer increases, which places higher requirements for the retailers to know what the customer wants. Retailers have no guarantees for survival or success in the trade of today. On the other hand, creative entrepreneurs instead have new opportunities. The corona pandemic has also increased the development of the digital customer journey, leading to retailers trying new approaches to reach their customers online, since the restrictions have complicated the physical shopping approach. Therefore, to offer the customer technological touchpoints in the customer journey have never been more important than what it is right now. Since the level of engagement is changing while the customer uses technological touchpoints instead of physical, this is an important factor for retailers to review to be able to manage innovative digital customer journeys. Moreover, the digital customer journey has increased a lot during recent years, which places higher requirements for the retailers to deliver a customer journey with quality. The purpose of this thesis is to understand how Swedish retailers (B2C) can manage technological touchpoints in customer journeys in the furniture sector, as well as to investigate how retailers can use technological touchpoints to change the quality and customer engagement in the customer journey. How can retailers manage technological touchpoints in customer journeys in the furniture sector? By examining how retailers can handle technological touchpoints in the customer journey in the furniture sector, the management of digital touchpoints has been different depending on whether it concerns companies using physical stores or e-commerce. There has also been a difference in the customer journey whether there is a specific department that works with the customer experience. This thesis has identified that retailers in the furniture sector manage technological touchpoints to create a seamless customer experience, increase customer satisfaction, more easily engage customers and to be able to integrate with customers in several ways. At the same time, this thesis identified that the interviewed companies work with technological touchpoints differently depending on the size of the company and how far they have come in technological development. It emerged in the thesis that retailers use a number of technological touchpoints such as websites, FAQs, apps, social media, chats and marketing in various channels. In the empirical findings, two perspectives of the future customer journey could be identified. The thesis showed that some participating companies saw a future with only technological touchpoints that could become a reality. Since everything physical will be able to happen digitally in the future, the companies can meet more customers and build relationships easier in more channels digitally. However, the thesis also identified that some companies believe that the customer experience needs to be delivered together through both physical stores and digital channels and therefore these companies believe that omni channels are important to be competitive on the market in the future. Participating companies further mentioned that the challenges with digital touchpoints also exist. The significant challenges that were identified are to visualize and create a physical feeling of the products digitally, to be able to feel and smell the products and that customers do not know what they are getting. Other challenges identified in the empirical findings was the customers' availability to easily spread bad reputation about companies and further that completely digital companies are never allowed to meet customers physically. It has also been identified that technological touchpoints are used by retailers in the furniture sector to create greater opportunity and availability for customers to make different choices. Furthermore, to easily create an innovative experience and faster produce communication. In summary, the basic reason for why furniture companies manage technological touchpoints is to create a good, accomplished experience for the customer and to be competitive on the market. By using digital touchpoints, this thesis has shown that the customer experience has improved in several ways, including the relationship between company and customer. Digital touchpoints have made it easier for companies to measure results and to be able to improve the customer journey. The thesis also shows that technological touchpoints create opportunities to meet customers in different channels, channels that may be completely digital in the future. How can retailers use technological touchpoints to change the quality & customer engagement in customer journeys? From empirical findings, it was identified that digitalization has made customers more involved in their own customer journey. Customers have been given more choice and flexibility as there are several different channels involved in the customer journey. The new technology has changed the customer's expectations, which means that the companies must find new innovative ways to be able to integrate with the customer. It also provides opportunities for retailers to meet the customer's needs and expectations. It was also identified that digitalization has enabled companies to engage the customer in several channels. One identification was that customer engagement has increased in relation to the increased digitalization, but also that the researched companies believe that digitization is vital for increasing customer engagement. All companies engage their customers in some way, but depending on the size, physical or digital channels they have different approaches to engaging their customers. It was also identified that the researched companies have many similarities when it comes to the philosophy with customer engagement, but that there are many aspects that affect their work and strategies around engagement. An identification that was a common denominator is that all companies use social media where the majority use competitions and influencers for engaging purposes. It was also identified that all companies work in some way with different systems for follow-up of customer engagement. Which means that all companies have a digitalization philosophy and focus on developing their technological touchpoints. Several companies also found that the level of engagement was higher when something negatively occurred in the customer journey, compared to if everything went well. This may be connected to the higher contrast between expectations and experience that comes with the digital touchpoints in the customer journey. Further it was identified that the majority of companies have the same mindset that digitalization has helped the researched companies create a better quality of the customer journey. Due to the technology, opportunities are created to be able to develop the quality of the customer journey. By being able to measure the customer journey, the companies gain an insight into what should be constantly improved. All companies work with quality improvement, in different ways, which has resulted in the customer's satisfaction also being increased. It was also identified that the technological touchpoints can create complexity as the customer's expectations increase, which places higher demands on the companies regarding product perception but also providing all information available. The technological touchpoints also place higher requirements on the customers ‘to be able to make things by themselves. This creates a different perception of quality level for each individual customer.",8612,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1573851/FULLTEXT01.pdf,TRUE,TRUE
Summarising,Large Source Text,TRUE,"Consumers display misconceptions and uncertainty about cookies online, often stemming from a lack of effort to seek explanations. This suggests a sense of hopelessness, as consumers perceive no value in acquiring knowledge about cookies.","Moreover, the hopelessness seems to be apparent in various circumstances online. For example, consumers seem to have several misconceptions regarding the use of cookies, and uncertainty concerning the nature of cookies is discernible. The empirical material suggests that this uncertainty and variety of misconceptions stem from the fact that consumers have not attempted to seek explanations or further information regarding the meaning of cookies. This in turn implies that consumers possess a hopelessness, in that there is nothing to gain from such knowledge, since, as an individual, such knowledge would amount to nothing. ","Dinev and Hart (2004) explain perceived risk as a product of an innate expectation within consumers, that institutions which possess personal information about an individual will use this information in negatively affecting manners. Empirical material of this study suggest that such a risk is present among consumers. For instance, personal information which was sold to third parties was frowned upon, as there existed uncertainties on how that information would be used and if it would be used in harmful ways. Moreover, certain types of information such as credit card information and personal identity numbers, were generally disclosed more carefully because of a sense of vulnerability among consumers. This vulnerability appears to be founded upon an innate expectation among consumers, that the disclosure of such information will repercuss negatively. However, the empirical material of this study implies that this innate expectation appears to be negligible. Consumers are aware of the risks, that personal information can be accessed by others and used to exploit the consumers, yet also appear to be unconcerned about these risks. Behaviourally, the empirical material suggest that the negligibility of the risks results in no effects on the consumers. In short, the risks do not appear to alter the behaviour of consumers in online environments. Among the aspects which can act as cause for this are safeguards. While consumers appear to be aware of the risks, safeguards such as two-way authentication and passwords seem to remove the perceived risks almost completely. Consumers’ trust in these technological countermeasures appears to outweigh the risks, which in turn might suggest that the action of extending an individual’s protective efforts to other parties is of appeal and interest to consumers. In a way, it appears as consumers enjoy sharing protective responsibilities with technological countermeasures provided by third parties. Further reasons diminishing the perceived risks among consumers appear to be a sense of hopelessness in an online context. It seems as consumers on an individual level have given up on the attempt to restrict the availability of personal information in online environments. Whether this availability refers to when companies and websites collect such information, or when individuals themselves disclose it, does not seem to be of importance, as empirical material suggest that consumers have an acceptance about the fact that personal information is available online. Consumers appear to generally consider online environments to be highly intertwined, in that personal information which has been disclosed on one website could result in its use on many others. This awareness in turn might imply that consumers’ perceived risks are overshadowed by a sense of hopelessness and acceptance while being online. Similarly, the collection of information through cookies for instance, appears to also be connected with acceptance and hopelessness. Cookies are perceived as parts of online environments which act and exist everywhere, and consumers feel like these are impossible to avoid. Due to this impossibility, there is no point in challenging its use. Since consumers are aware of the availability of their information, there is no point in trying to restrict it. This sense of hopelessness appears to be extended to anonymity, with consumers realizing that attempting to be anonymous in online environments is impossible. Generally, consumers appear to be aware that their personal information is readily available, resulting in acceptance of its existence. Moreover, the hopelessness seems to be apparent in various circumstances online. For example, consumers seem to have several misconceptions regarding the use of cookies, and uncertainty concerning the nature of cookies is discernible. The empirical material suggests that this uncertainty and variety of misconceptions stem from the fact that consumers have not attempted to seek explanations or further information regarding the meaning of cookies. This in turn implies that consumers possess a hopelessness, in that there is nothing to gain from such knowledge, since, as an individual, such knowledge would amount to nothing. Even if consumers would have the knowledge of how cookies work, any negative aspects of their use would be impervious to the actions of any individual. This same reasoning among consumers seems to be apparent regarding websites’ information handling policies. In this instance too, consumers have misconceptions of the content of these policies, due to a sense of hopelessness. Even if they would bother with reading these policies, due to either concern or genuine interest, consumers perceive that such knowledge would be useless. Essentially, it appears that consumers perceive their situations in online contexts as hopeless, where they have no incentives to attempt to increase their knowledge of how websites use their personal information. However, it is interesting to consider that if consumers instead had incentives to increase their knowledge of how websites use personal information, this hopelessness might be diminished, since such knowledge could result in restriction of the availability of personal information. Empirical material furthermore discloses that perceived risks altered consumers’ behaviour in the past, while also providing findings that this is no longer the case. This might imply that consumers’ perceptions of risks have changed over time. In the past, consumers held concerns in regard to disclosing personal information, yet seem to have changed in this aspect. Findings of this study suggest three main aspects which could be connected to this change. The hopelessness which consumers appear to possess in online contexts, in the sense that an individual’s actions are inconsequential, has prompted an acceptance among consumers, that restriction of availability of personal information is impossible. Similarly, the development and application of technological safeguards also could have added to the culmination of the change. Together, it appears as if these three aspects have diminished consumers perceived risks of personal information disclosure over time. In continuation, given the fact that consumers previously had issues with disclosing personal information online, the hopelessness seem to have been less apparent in the past. Perceptions that online environments were not as intertwined could have made consumers concerned rather than hopeless, since they might have believed that their individual actions would have an effect on the restriction of the availability of personal information online. This suggests that it was not until consumers realized the extensive connectivity of online environments, and that caring about disclosure of personal information was pointless, that their concerns turned to hopelessness. Regarding consumers’ perceptions of covert and overt data collection, Aguirre et al. (2015) state that covert methods can result in negative perceptions, while overt collection methods can minimize negative consumer perceptions. Findings of this study seem to suggest that the previously discussed hopelessness and acceptance have implications in this, since consumers generally are unconcerned with either data collection method. Even if companies explicitly inform consumers of privacy policies, cookie policies and information handling, consumer perceptions appear unchanged, since reading such information is not seen as advantageous or useful. As such, this study’s findings argue that the nature of a website’s data collection methods have no implications for the perceptions of consumers. Instead, it appears that consumers have accepted the fact that websites collect data, and whether they are overt or covert does not appear to matter. Furthermore, regarding these data collection methods, the speed of which personal information was displayed in form of online personalized advertisements, appeared to be a negatively perceived matter. These findings suggest that when information is used in such a fast manner, consumers might be reminded of how fast personal information becomes available. Continuing with the theoretical findings of contemporary research, Aguirre et al. (2015) and Dinev and Hart (2004) argue that positive experiences derived from the disclosure of personal information will decrease consumers’ privacy concerns. The findings of this study however, suggest that the disclosure of personal information, resulting in positive experiences, is not necessarily affiliated with privacy concerns. Consumers’ perceived risks appear to be miniscule, only slightly fluctuated by the disclosure of increased sensitivity of information, such as credit card information, or the context in which this information is provided. In a way, increased benefits, or positive experiences, do not seem to result in decreased perceived risks or privacy concerns. Instead, consumers merely possess an awareness of the risks, which is not influenced by the benefits. Moreover, empirical findings suggest that consumers have no issues with increasing the amount of personal information disclosure, if such information is used to their benefit. Furthermore, Zhu and Chang (2016) argue that the relevance of online personalized advertisements mitigates consumers’ privacy concerns. This is not something that is apparent based on the empirical findings of this study, as privacy concerns is not affected by the relevance of the advertisements. Instead, consumers appear to be willing to disclose more personal information in exchange for increased relevance. This in turn implies that as long as consumers perceive personalized content to be beneficial, disclosing additional information would be acceptable as the risks are negligible.",9859,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1109489/FULLTEXT01.pdf,TRUE,TRUE
Summarising,Large Source Text,TRUE,"The study suggests that the results may be influenced by the ""in-group bias"" mechanism, where favoritism towards individuals with similar characteristics could play a role. However, this mechanism falls outside the scope of the current paper.","Our explanations for these results can be related to the mechanism “in-group bias” where favoritism due to similar characteristics between the grader and the students could have had an impact. Thus this mechanism is beyond the scope of our paper, and we can therefore not conclusively say what factors contributed to these results considering the graders gender but this mechanism could be interesting to test in future studies.","As mentioned in our introduction section, there are is range of studies that investigate treatment effects against minority groups in different sectors. We focused on the schooling sector since grades are of major importance for future references and studys but also when entering the labour market. As Diamond and Persson showed that there are long-term consequences when considering earnings and the human capital. By using a difference-in-difference method on our obtained data from introductory macroeconomic sample, we are able to conclude that our results did not show any negative treatment effect against foreign-named students. These results are implemented through the fact that foreign-named students received even lower test scores after the reform, thus we can say that the graders treated the foreign-named students positively. When considering these results we can conclude that they show the opposite from previous similar studies conducted by Hinnerich, Höglin and Johannesson (2014), Sprietsma (2013), Botelho et al (2015) and (Van Ewijk, 2011). As mentioned in our introduction, discrimination is an interesting topic especially on a university level. Most universities have a diversified environment where students have different foreign backgrounds and also that it occurs a lot of exchange of students between countries. Furthermore we can conclude that the results deviate from the theory about Statistical discrimination and Becker’s theory about Taste-based discrimination due to the lack of negative treatment effects on foreign-named students. However an explanation could instead be due to the theory about “reversed-bias” by Behaghel et.al (2015). The positive treatment against foreign-named students could be due to a more compensating and a more lenient treatment for groups or minorities considered to be less privileged. This ‘’reversed-bias” can also be related to the fact that the macroeconomic exam was written in Swedish, thus this could imply that the graders overlooked the language and writing abilities and graded the foreign students in a more compliant way. In addition our second aim for this study was to investigate if there is a relationship between the graders gender and the treatment effect of the students. By extending our regression with a dummy for the graders gender, we conducted results showing that female graders treated foreign-named students more negatively compared to male graders. The male graders showed results of a strong positive treatment effect against foreign-named students, but hence a negative treatment against Swedish named students. Moreover the female graders showed a positive treatment effect against Swedish-named students, and due to a slight decrease in test scores for foreign named students after the reform and fundamentally low test scores prior the reform therefore we came to our conclusion.  These results however show the opposite compared to the study by Carlsson and Rooth (2007) where they found that male recruiters on the Swedish labour market tended to discriminate foreign applicants compared to female recruiters.  Our explanations for these results can be related to the mechanism “in-group bias” where favoritism due to similar characteristics between the grader and the students could have had an impact. Thus this mechanism is beyond the scope of our paper, and we can therefore not conclusively say what factors contributed to these results considering the graders gender but  this mechanism could be interesting to test in future studies. In the essence of our research questions we can conclude that there was no negative treatment effect against foreign-named students, and that female graders showed a more negative treatment effect against foreign named students compared to the male graders.",3803,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1453705/FULLTEXT01.pdf,TRUE,TRUE

The purpose highlighted in the text is to further explore and explain the relationship between these social media content characteristics and consumers' purchase intentions, underlining the need for continued research in this area due to the influential nature of social media on consumer behavior.","Social Media Content consists of characteristics by which have been found by previous research to have an influence on consumers' purchase intention. The social media content can be created by any social media user, who are referred to as content creators, whereby the degree of impact the social media content has on consumers' purchase intention is difficult to predict. There are specifically three social media content characteristics that have been shown to be more strongly related to consumers’ purchase intention than others, which are Usefulness, Informativeness and Interactivity.

Previous research suggests that further investigation regarding consumers’ purchase intention in relation to the online context is of relevance to research since social media content is an influential factor regarding consumers’ purchase intention, for an increased explanation of consumers’ purchase intention. The rise of social media has led to a change in the way marketers conduct their marketing strategies (Kotler et al., 2016; Alalwan, 2018). Instead of using a traditional marketing approach, various online platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are being used as tools for marketers to create material such as advertisement and other marketing activities (Alalwan, 2018). As social media has become such a dominant part of people’s lives (Arli, 2017) the rise of marketers' usage of social media is due consumers tending to rely decisions upon “content” provided on social media (Hutter et al., 2013). Social media allows for any user to take part of the online environment where “content”, as in other words is described as social media content, is considered to be constructed in the form of pictures, comments, ideas, videos, text, opinions, discussions and so on (Khatib, 2016), which can be created by any social media user. The creators of a content, henceforth referred to as content creators, can both be those who directly wish to affect those absorbing the content, such as marketers (Hutter et al., 2013), but they can also be regular people creating content based on their thoughts or opinions without having an underlying intention of directly influencing someone (Alalwan, 2018). In comparison to the traditional space where marketing previously solely took place, such as through television, newspaper, radio and magazines (Schivinski and Dabrowski, 2016), social media is allowing a two-way interaction between content creators and consumers (Arli, 2017). Research states that this way of communication becomes of higher value for consumers (Alalwan, 2018) since many decisions are based upon influences from the content provided on social media, as previously mentioned by Hutter et al., (2013). Social media content has shown to play an increasing part in consumers Purchase Intention, which in practise is an effect from communication activities on social media (Hutter et al., 2013; Alalwan, 2018; Arli, 2017). The purchase intention is a part of the decision making process, whereby consumers go through mental stages of absorbing, processing and evaluating social media content to decide upon the possibility for a future purchase of a service or product. The value that the consumer perceives within the social media content generates the extent to which the consumer has been influenced towards a purchase (Hutter et al., 2013). However, it is challenging for content creators to expect a certain degree of what impact social media content has on consumers' purchase intention due to the fact that not all consumers are affected by the same social media content in the same way (Schlosser et al., 2003; Alalwan, 2018). Nonetheless, there are various characteristics that are embodied within the social media content of what is communicated which influences certain steps within the decision process where some have the ability to specifically influence consumers’ purchase intention (Richard, 2005; Hausman and Siekpe, 2009). This is based upon collected research which states that some characteristics are more strongly related to purchase intention than others, which has shown to be the characteristics of Usefulness (Arli, 2017; Sin et al., 2012; Rauniar et al., 2014), Informativeness (Arli, 2017; Alalwan, 2018; Chu et al., 2013) and Interactivity (Alalwan, 2018; Hajli, 2016).",4320,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-3523&pid=diva2%3A1442530&c=32&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=&af=%5B%22topOrganisationId%3A4853%22%2C%22language%3Aeng%22%2C%22thesisLevel%3AM2%22%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=undergraduate,TRUE,TRUE
Summarising,Large Source Text,TRUE,"The study found that most interviewees sent remittances to family and relatives out of altruism, motivated by a desire to support them financially. Additionally, some interviewees sent remittances to maintain favor in inheritance by supporting their parents.","The study resulted in the conclusion that most of the interviewees' motives were that they send remittances to family, and relatives because of altruism. Within the altruistic motives, the interviewees have been clear in explaining the receivers, for example, the family and relatives' circumstances in the home country, which means that they need financial support. We identified that some interviewees sent remittances and supported their parents in the home country to maintain favor in inheritance.","In this concluding chapter, we summarize and discuss the conclusion of the study together with reflections on the study's results and implementation. The chapter is rounded off with suggestions for further research that could supplement and broaden the knowledge about the study area further. The purpose of this study is to investigate, analyze, and gain an in-depth understanding of what motives migrants have that make them remit and how they are affected socially and economically by sending remittances from Sweden. A qualitative approach was taken, and eight semi-structured interviews with Swedish migrants with Iraqi and Somali backgrounds were conducted in order to collect data for analysis. The study resulted in the conclusion that most of the interviewees' motives were that they send remittances to family, and relatives because of altruism. Within the altruistic motives, the interviewees have been clear in explaining the receivers, for example, the family and relatives' circumstances in the home country, which means that they need financial support. We identified that some interviewees sent remittances and supported their parents in the home country to maintain favor in inheritance. Another reason we identified is tempered altruism or enlightened self-interest, that some interviewees remit with the intention of helping their family but also returning home, they invest in family and home. The interviewees informed us of their experience regarding the social and economic impact of sending remittances. They state that despite difficulties, they choose to continue to remit to their families in their origin country. The interviewees don’t see their social situation being impacted by sending remittances. Our interviewees’ production activity is that they can speak the language, work, pay taxes, follow laws, and hence they don’t see themselves as socially excluded from the majority of the society. We found that what mattered most to our interviewees was their social activity, they interact with mainstream society and identify with a cultural group in the host country. Their transnational ties are very important for them, and if they did not have them, they feel that they may have seen themselves socially excluded. However, they express how their economic situation is impacted by sending money to their families in the origin country. Almost all of our interviewees informed us how their saving activity is impacted by sending remittances and this indicates that they are socially excluded. The other economic factor that is impacted by remittances is the interviewees’ consumption, for example, they don’t have the resources for hobbies. The interviewees who remit too often did not choose to have an activity in their free time that required them to pay for it, because they thought that the family in the homeland would need the money. Since this research is not extensive enough to draw general conclusions, we can only say that some people can be impacted socially and economically by sending remittances, and there may be a larger social pattern. To find this out, a larger and more comprehensive study must be done with more respondents. As this study is not comprehensive enough to be able to draw a general conclusion about this, we can only state that it is prevalent for some individuals such as our interviewees. It can be said that our interviewees are in a state of limited economic, social and cultural resources and opportunities, because remittances limit their economy, so they cannot maintain a socially acceptable presence in Sweden according to Burchardt et al. (1999) social exclusion concept. Our interviewees don’t see their social situation as socially excluded from the majority of society, however, we have noticed that they didn’t have the opportunity to choose employment themselves to which they are trained. Our interviewees are trained in their homeland as civil engineers, but work as assistant nurses, psychologists as teachers, biomedical researchers as nurses, and pharmacists as opticians. Their choices and thereby opportunities being limited by the fact that they have to send money to their countries of origin and thus force them to prioritize work over education, and other barriers that arise when moving to another country and learning a new language. Our interviewees may be marginalized compared to the majority society and their social position may depend on other factors than their remittances, such as being a migrant. For Swedish society, it is important not to forget that our interviewees are migrants themselves not only live in relationships related to the Swedish context but also live in a network of transnational relationships, which have gone far beyond the borders of Sweden. The interviewees have expressed that they have better living standards than their families in the origin country. This is a comparison, where the migrants try to compare their living conditions and living standards with their families in the country of origin. Their situation depends on whom or with whom the migrant compares. People who compare themselves with Swedish measures may think they are socially excluded, while those who compare themselves with their country of origin may not see themselves as socially excluded at all, but quite the opposite. Our interviewees have fled from war-torn countries and if they try to compare their living conditions and standards with their families in the origin country then of course they will not see themselves as socially excluded. However, the interviewees have expressed several times how content they are with what they have and how they are helping and being an important person to their families and relatives. This study’s results are similar to previous research’s results and this was noticed during our interviews. The previous research was conducted in different countries, but their findings were somehow similar. Our results were no different, it showed that remittances impact Swedish migrants similarly. This study’s result contributes to the previous research, a result that is based on Swedish migrants, especially on the Iraqi and Somali communities.",6190,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1532847/FULLTEXT01.pdf,TRUE,TRUE
Summarising,Large Source Text,TRUE,China has moved away from low-skilled labor towards prioritizing education to secure better jobs and avoid competition with robots. This has transformed it from having the world's largest cheap labor force to the world's largest skilled labor pool.,The transition from low-skilled labor has resulted in the Chinese population choosing education to find a good job and avoid competing with robots that are taking over the production lines in traditional low-skilled labor factories. China has made a tremendous transition from the world's largest pool of cheap labor force into the world's largest skilled labor pool.,"In response to the research question, the authors have seen an impact on the manufacturing industry due to the increasing robotics, automation, and digitalization. One obvious consequence is the growing middle class in China which in turn had led to a more domestic and local market characterized by consumer-based services. Which was not the case when the interviewees of this study first came to China, back then china was characterized by being a manufacturing powerhouse with cheap and low skilled workers. Nowadays, the manufacturing industry is developed with high technological automation solutions. The growing middle class has enabled the domestic market to grow due to the increased purchasing power, resulting in the GDP in China having seen drastic increases during the last years, where the estimated GDP rates are predicted to reach double figures. So, there have been positive effects on the Chinese economy due to the modernized manufacturing industry, to the requirement of a more competent workforce where the Chinese government has put much effort to promote education in order to cope with the digital challenges. In the large picture, there have been mostly positive effects. However, the old, uneducated workforce is suffering from this development. Answering the sub question After analyzing the robotics effects on Chinese manufacturing the authors can conclude that robotics has created both positive and negative effects for the manufacturing industry and the Chinese Economy. Positive effects After comparing the theoretical framework with statements from our interviewees and the content in the second-hand interviews, we can draw the conclusion that increased higher-level education has been a common denominator as an effect of robotics in manufacturing. The transition from low-skilled labor has resulted in the Chinese population choosing education to find a good job and avoid competing with robots that are taking over the production lines in traditional low-skilled labor factories. China has made a tremendous transition from the world's largest pool of cheap labor force into the world's largest skilled labor pool. Robotic effects on education are positive for the manufacturing industry since it results in more competent personnel and positive for the Chinese economy since higher education results in higher wages for the workers, which means they will have more money to consume. Another positive effect on the manufacturing industry is the increased quality of the manufactured products. Both interviewees have mentioned that there has been a severe change in quality since they first visited China. Robotics has enabled a new level of quality insurance, enabling the companies to decrease manufacturing waste and increase their volumes, quality, efficiency, and revenue. Robotics has created a higher standard for Chinese manufacturers, which is good since foreign companies can see quality assurance as beneficial. The authors can see that robotics has created a higher standard with well-educated staff in the manufacturing sector. The financial aspects for the manufacturing companies have also been positive since robotics entered the factory floors. Robots have enabled companies to decrease their labor cost. On the other hand, a conclusion can be drawn that robots help companies increase their revenue since robotics can operate 24/7 and produce high standards; it has helped companies expand and maintain or develop their competitive edge. Negative effects The negative effects of the increased number of robots and automated solutions mostly affects the elderly labor without any education as Hou Bingtao said that his friends without any education or training will be competing and, in the end, replaced by machines. Bingtao is aware that machines will replace him as the development of robots will continue to be a tangible trend in the Chinese manufacturing industry. This could be problematic since the elder has to change their career at a late stage in their life, which is an issue because the elder is not an attractive selection for the employers to hire. As mentioned in the interviews, the respondents have witnessed a more consumer-based market with a focus on services. Another consequence of robotics and automatization is that Chinese manufacturers are leaving the domestic market and exploiting foreign markets, for instance, in India, where the product cost is less than it is in China. This affects the elderly population in China negatively because the work opportunities for uneducated workers are reduced when large manufacturers are leaving the market. However, this is an opportunity for workers with an education, especially technicians responsible for the robots to function effectively. So, it is evident that the labor market has changed in China due to robotization, where the educated gain from the changes while the uneducated workers suffer, as the wages in manufacturing are increasing. The increased wages are a reason why manufacturers are leaving China to seek opportunities in countries where the costs and wages are less than in China. However, as Kesten mentioned, there is still a demand for manual workers to some extent, but there has been a significant reduction regarding that matter. Nevertheless, as the development of automation continues, the demand for low educated labor will decrease, leading to continuously increasing wages as the demand for competent integrators, technicians, and engineers increases.",5508,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1576676/FULLTEXT01.pdf,TRUE,TRUE
Summarising,Large Source Text,TRUE,"The text discusses how firms utilize online personalized advertisements to gain and maintain a competitive edge. By gathering data on individual consumers, companies can tailor their online ads to target specific individuals, enhancing the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.","The use of online personalized advertisements has drawn attention among firms, in efforts of acquiring and maintaining competitive advantage. By collecting individual consumer information, firms are able to personalize advertisements to specific individuals in online contexts.","The use of online personalized advertisements has drawn attention among firms, in efforts of acquiring and maintaining competitive advantage. By collecting individual consumer information, firms are able to personalize advertisements to specific individuals in online contexts. The collection and use of individuals’ personal information have given rise to privacy concerns among consumers. However, contemporary research displays disparate conclusions regarding the extent to which these privacy concerns influence the effectiveness of online personalized advertisements. In order to provide insights regarding this discrepancy, this study explored the theoretical foundations of consumer perceived benefits and risks, upon which contemporary research was based. Two focus groups were conducted to explore how consumers perceive benefits and risks of online personalized advertisements. Using pattern matching, the interpretation of the empirically gathered material implied that consumer perceived benefits, in form of perceived relevance, appears to be insufficient in appealing to the interests and  preferences of consumers. Instead, consumers’ perceptions of relevance appear to be dependent on several elements. Furthermore, the findings imply that consumers are aware of the risks through personal information disclosure, yet appear to be unconcerned by them. Instead, consumers seem to possess a sense of hopelessness in online environments, that attempts to restrict the availability of their personal information are pointless. In order to more effectively acquire and maintain competitive advantage, firms and companies have progressively been shifting their resources to dynamic, online personalized advertisements, from generic, i.e. non-consumer specific or mass-targeted (Bleier & Eisenbeiss, 2015). These online personalized advertisements are made possible through the utilization of extensive consumer data accumulated from a wide array of data collection platforms (Aguirre, Mahr, Grewal, de Ruyter & Wetzels, 2015), and refer to advertisements which have been customized, individualized, or profiled towards a specific consumer in an online context (Köster, Rüth, Hamborg & Kaspar, 2015). Baek and Morimoto (2012) discuss the concept of personalization in online contexts, stating that it consists of a broad scope of communication strategies and activities whose objective is to, on an individual level, target and customize exclusive offers and promotions. Similarly, according to Maslowska, Smit and van den Putte (2016), personalization generally encompasses communication strategies which involve “incorporating elements in messages that refer to each individual recipient and are based on the recipient’s personal characteristics, such as name, gender, residence, occupation and past behaviors” (p. 74). Furthermore, as data collection methods and tools of analysis have progressed, so has the range of personal characteristics, having come to include “online activities, interests, preferences, and/or communications over time and across websites” of specific individuals (Zhu & Chang, 2016, p. 442). In other words, marketers try to present the offer in such a way that it is personalized to the individual consumer (Baek & Morimoto, 2012). The practice of personalizing advertisements has proved a superiority over the generic antecedents of advertising (Baek & Morimoto, 2012; Tucker, 2014; Wang, Yang, Chen & Zhang, 2015). Tucker (2014) discusses among other things that online personalized advertisements might facilitate a positive increase in consumers’ appeal and interest towards the advertisement, and Baek and Morimoto (2012) furthermore express that these advertisements simplify the processes of gathering and analysing measurable responses in communication campaigns. Online personalized advertisements are perceived by consumers to be more accurate, meaning that there has been an increased impact on consumers, after having presented offers in personalized versions to specific individuals (Baek & Morimoto, 2012). Wang et al. (2015) present a rationale regarding 2 the advantages of online personalized advertisements, from both an advertiser perspective and a consumer perspective. Advertisers can expect increased revenue through targeting consumers with greater willingness to purchase, and consumers are able to more efficiently locate advertisements, and thus products or services, which are of greater relevance and interest to them. In this process, online personalized advertising is capable of increasing revenue per advertisement by 2.68 times compared to generic advertisements (Wang et al., 2015). 1.2 Problem Discussion The recent upsurge of online personalized advertisements as a key communication strategy for advertisers is an area of considerable industry and academic interest (Aguirre et al., 2015; Baek & Morimoto, 2012; Bleier & Eisenbeiss, 2015; Jay & Cude, 2009; Kim & Huh, 2017; Wang et al., 2015). However, despite this upsurge, few academic researchers have examined consumer responses to it (Jay & Cude, 2009). While there have been reports on disadvantages for advertisers using online personalized advertisements (Wang et al., 2015), the most controversial research concerns a consumer-specific disadvantage, a response in form of privacy concerns. Wang et al. (2015) refer to the findings of a survey on Americans’ use of internet which state that 68% of 1729 participants expressed disapproval of online personalized advertising because of the use of one’s personal information, i.e. having their behaviour tracked and analysed. The survey also showed that 73% of 802 participants were displeased with search engines keeping track of one’s searches and using that information to personalize future search results (Purcell, Brenner & Raine, 2012). Wang et al. (2015) explain that the privacy concerns that consumers have stem from the intense and aggressive way that marketers track one’s online behaviour to collect information such as hobbies and desires. The information collected can also be far more personal and sensitive than that; for example, if an individual is searching for a specific kind of medicine, it is likely that the user may have diseases related to their search. Wang et al. (2015) suggest that such information should be private to the individual user, and not for sale to marketers. Consumers also raise concerns about the fact that marketers which use online personalized advertising seldom disclose how the information about the individuals is obtained, making consumers experience vulnerability, or the sense of being constantly observed and tracked (Rapp, Hill, Gaines & Wilson, 2009; Wang et al., 2015). This has practical implications on the approaches 3 of marketers and advertisers, motivating them to find ways which can mitigate these effects. Despite this, the utilisation of online personalized advertisements continues to grow (Bleier & Eisenbeiss, 2015), as does investments in its use and subsequent return on investments (Wang et al., 2015). This suggests that consumers may not be as influenced by privacy concerns as reported by prior studies. Moreover, there exists evidence suggesting that consumers can hold privacy concerns and still acknowledge and use the benefits provided through online personalized advertisements (Bleier & Eisenbeiss, 2015). Research on privacy concerns in relation to online personalized advertisements has explored it primarily to see its influence on company or business related matters (Aguirre et al., 2015; Baek & Morimoto, 2012; Maslowska, Smit & van den Putte, 2016; Tucker, 2014; Wang et al, 2015; Zhu & Chang, 2016). Commonly, these matters entail the effectiveness of online personalized advertisements, which has been referred to as click-through rates, i.e. the chance of users who see an advertisement actually click on it, behavioural and attitudinal responses, and organizational indicators from the perspective of businesses (Aguirre et al., 2015; Kim & Huh, 2017; Tucker, 2014; Wang et al, 2015). Aguirre et al. (2015) for instance, focus on the paradoxical situation in which consumers experience increased benefits through personalization, yet may also experience an increase in sense of vulnerability through it, ultimately influencing the effectiveness of online personalized advertisements. Tucker (2014) instead investigated how the perceptions of control over personal information among internet users affect subsequent click-through rates. Both these studies are thus concerned with the influence that consumers’ perceptions have on the effectiveness of online personalized advertisements. Comparable studies have researched the effects of perceived relevance of an online personalized advertisement and its role in mitigating privacy concerns (Maslowska, Smit & van den Putte, 2016; Zhu & Chang, 2016), the conceptualization of theoretical frameworks for privacy in targeted advertising (Wang et al., 2015), and reasons for why consumers might attempt to avoid online personalized advertising (Baek & Morimoto, 2012). Consequently, the perspective of businesses has been among the most prominently applied across contemporary research. Commonly acknowledged in the abovementioned research, is that privacy concerns negatively influence the effectiveness of online personalized advertisements, due to the 4 perceived risks of consumers (Aguirre et al., 2015; Bleier & Eisenbeiss, 2015; Tucker, 2014; Zhu & Chang, 2016). However, the research disagrees upon to which degree perceived risks negatively influence this effectiveness. Bleier and Eisenbeiss (2015) suggest a significant negative influence on the effectiveness of online personalized advertisements while the research by Kim and Huh (2017) instead suggest that perceived risks do not have a significant negative influence. The results of their research conclude that because of the perceived benefits consumers hold towards online personalized advertisements, the perceived risks are negligible (Kim & Huh, 2017). This discrepancy proves that an incomplete understanding of consumers’ perceived risks and benefits exists, as these have been the theoretical foundations of the contrasting research, ultimately influencing the results. As such further exploration regarding how consumers perceive risks and benefits of online personalized advertisement is required. Moreover, for future research to more accurately identify company related matters, such as effectiveness of online personalized advertisements, a more thorough understanding of the theoretical foundations is required. As such, this study excludes the influences which consumer perceptions have on the effectiveness of online personalized advertisements, focusing instead solely on the theoretical foundations of how consumers perceive risks and benefits.

During the past year, when the Covid-19 pandemic has ravaged among us, food consumption has also become a fact. Grocery stores have had the opportunity to develop their e-commerce and offer their customers a chance to purchase products at any time suitable. As the market is evolving, the concept of consumer behavior and impulse buying behavior has become more relevant and exciting in research. Still, little research has been done regarding how grocery stores influence consumers’ impulse buying behavior when shopping for groceries online. The purpose of this research, from a business perspective, is to investigate how grocery companies influence consumers' impulse buying behavior online and to identify if there are any contributing factors to influencing this behavior. The aim is to develop a more profound knowledge within this topic due to the lack of previous research on impulse buying behavior when shopping for groceries online. The conclusion of this thesis shows that impulse purchases increase the additional sales to the store and that there are clear strategies for how the grocery stores do to influence the impulse buying behavior in the physical store. However, the study showed that grocery stores do not actively work to influence consumers' impulse buying behavior when shopping for groceries online as they do not have the power to implement them. This is because the head offices control their e commerce. oday more Swedes are choosing to make their grocery purchases in the digital sphere (Svensk digital handel, 2018). A topic that is frequently discussed in ordinary daily life through media and businesses is e-commerce and grocery shopping. In this thesis, the research area is focused on the Swedish grocery trade. According to Svensk digital handel (2018) almost every third consumer shopped for groceries online in 2017. Recent research on grocery sales online has shown that by 2022 it is most likely that 10 percent of all food sales will take place online (Saunders, 2018). When consumers begin to see the benefits of shopping for groceries online, it encourages industry players to develop their offerings to live up to customer requirements by creating a good frictionless shopping experience (Svensk digital handel, 2018). Nowadays, most large grocery chains run multichannel stores with both offline stores and online stores (Campo & Breugelmans, 2015). As online shopping for groceries has increased a lot over the years, grocery trading companies have had to expand their service levels by using multi-channels, which has been much appreciated by the grocery companies' customers (ibid). According to Campo and Breugelmans (2015) the majority of customers who buy groceries online are so-called multichannel shoppers as they combine both online and offline shopping. The online grocery trade in Sweden has increased, and the year 2021 began with continued high pressure where sales growth amounted to 137.8 percent, home delivery increased by 75 percent and in-store pickup by 252 percent (Svensk dagligvaruhandel, 2021). What was also stated is that the e-commerce share in the grocery trade in January was the highest share measured in the Grocery Index (ibid). One of the main focuses in this thesis is impulsive buying, and this concept is identified as one of the core aspects of increased sales due to the fact that impulse purchases can account for up to 60 percent of all purchases in-store (Amos, Holmes & Keneson, 2014). More consumers are seeing the benefits of shopping for groceries online, and special offers and cheaper deliveries are the factors that attract new customers. Online shoppers want to save tim2(61) they assume that they make fewer impulse purchases when shopping for groceries online (Svensk digital handel, 2018). To influence consumer's impulse buying behavior, companies put much focus on the environmental attributes that are designed to attract consumers' attention in terms of color and layout are called atmospheric clues (Sarah et al. 2020). In an online environment, these atmospheric clues are divided into three main categories, e-store content, e-store design, and e-store navigation (ibid). According to Sarah et al. (2020) E-store content includes all communicated material available on a website, such as product auctions, price offers, return policies, and contact information. It is also explained that the e-store content is very important for increasing visitor traffic and the use of a website (ibid). E-store design is defined as the extent to which a person believes that the e-store is aesthetically pleasing in the form of the overall layout of the website and the colors used (ibid). E-store navigation, which is the third and final category, is described by Sarah et al. (2020) as the organization and hierarchical layout of the content and pages of an online store. These include directions, menus, sitemaps, and colors that help users run the website. According to Sarah et al. (2020) growth in e-commerce and technological development is a major contributing factor to the increase in impulse purchases online. Online impulse buying is defined as “a sudden and immediate online purchase with no pre-shopping intentions” (Chan, Cheung & Lee, 2017). Related to this, some researchers suggest that consumers who shop online are more impulsive than traditional shoppers who shop in-store (Sarah et al. 2020). This can be supported by Chan, Cheung and Lee (2017) as the online shopping environment is considered to be more liberating for consumers as the restrictions are not as great as in the offline environment. These limitations can, for example be, inconvenient store locations, limited opening hours, and social pressures from staff and other consumers (Chan, Cheung & Lee, 2017). Previous research conducted in the field of online impulse buying behavior shows that approximately 40 percent of all online consumer spending can be attributed to impulse buying (ibid). A consumer makes unplanned purchases when they are exposed to stimulation cues that are associated with a strong need and desire (Wu, Chiu & Chen, 2020). In a study done by Campo and Breugelmans (2015), customers' buying behavior tends to vary depending on whether they buy their groceries in-store or online. An example of this is that a product's intangible performance may have a relatively low level of online entry as many customers prefer to be able to physically examine the products before buying them (ibid). According to Campo and Breugelmans (2015) previous research has also shown that households tend to be more brand loyal and size loyal, but less price3(61) categories that tend to sell best in the online store are the major and most popular categories. Glanz, Bader, and Iyer (2012) explain different trends within the retail grocery stores which continue to dominate the food sales. Store brands or private labels have increased in sales due to that the consumer's priorities quality, taste, and price (ibid). Although the demand for loyalty cards and coupons and that planned purchase and price awareness remains important, consumers report that impulsive choices often get triggered by end-of-aisle and by other in-store promotions (ibid). Liao, Shen and Chu (2009) believe that impulse purchases are an important part for companies in the retail trade, due to the fact that impulse purchases can account for over 80 percent of total sales in certain product categories such as candy and magazines. Retailers are interested in the impulse buying behavior concept due to the fact that they want to influence their customers to make these impulse purchases to generate more sales (Amos, Holmes & Keneson, 2014). According to Sverigesradio (2013) the total purchases increase by 10 percent if the customer gets influenced in the entrance of the store, with products that the customer had not intended to buy, therefore it is often gender-neutral products that everyone probably needs. Another factor that is important for influencing a customer to make an impulse purchase is the placement of the products in the store because it is proven that good product placement can be decisive for whether a customer will buy the product or not (Företagsforumet, 2021). If the product placement is good, it can lead to the customer making an impulse purchase, a purchase that was not planned to make (ibid). This leads to a discussion of the problem that has been identified, where the authors of this thesis clearly can see that less research has been studied previously about how grocery stores influence their customers’ impulse buying behavior when shopping for groceries online. The problem discussion will be discussed more deeply in the part below.",8847,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-3523&pid=diva2%3A1562178&c=24&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=&af=%5B%22topOrganisationId%3A4853%22%2C%22language%3Aeng%22%2C%22thesisLevel%3AM2%22%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=undergraduate,FALSE,TRUE
Summarising,Large Source Text,TRUE,"The text discusses the issue of limited educational access for many children today, particularly refugees. It highlights a significant gap in educational opportunities, noting that despite supposed rights to education, refugee children often receive less access compared to other children. This situation is described as a failure in terms of children's development and a violation of their human rights.","Today, there are many children that are not allowed, or have the possibility to go to school and get an education which is a failure towards children's development in relation to human rights. Despite that refugees are supposed to have rights to be provided education, they are reported getting lower access to education than other children.","Today, there are many children that are not allowed, or have the possibility to go to school and get an education which is a failure towards children's development in relation to human rights. Despite that refugees are supposed to have rights to be provided education, they are reported getting lower access to education than other children. The purpose of this study is to understand the educational contribution from an organisation’s perspective and how to understand what needs to develop to ensure all refugee children with education. The research question that this study is based on is: How can we understand the role of education at a young age for refugees in relation to children's development? The method chosen for this study is a case study through two reports of the United Nation High Commissioner (UNHCR) to collect data of their education strategy implemented in a project called Educate A Child. Theory selected to analyse and understand the strategy is Pierre Bourdieu's theory of Field, Capital, and Habitus. The conclusion of the study is that the educational sector has several factors that play different roles. Teacher’s training is of great importance and must be taken more into account in their role and responsibility towards the children, the economic capital is important to be able to develop opportunities for children to attend school, and inclusion and partnership also play a great role. Today, there are many children that are not allowed, or have the possibility to go to school and get an education which is a failure towards children's development in relation to human rights. Agenda 2030 in their fourth goal of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), quality education, has become one major contributor to force this development globally around the world (UN, n.d). The goal focus on eliminating discrimination and provide access to including education of high quality, which is of most relevance for refugee children. Education as a tool can act to protect children from being used, unhealthy lifestyles and even death (Horst & Aden, 2021). Before children become refugees, they often live in countries with ongoing conflicts which can mean that they do not have any education at all before leaving their home country. Many refugee children and teachers describe the constant travelling and consistent behaviour of moving around disturbing and as a disruption in their life (Dryden-Peterson, 2015, p.7). Many refugee children living in host countries to ongoing conflicts are experiencing a lack of educational support and individual inclusion as a true challenge. Despite that refugees are supposed to have rights to be provided education, they are reported getting lower access to education than other children. In 2014, reports showed that 50% of refugees were provided access to primary school and arecontinuing to be persistent numbers (Dryden-Peterson, Adelman, Bellino, Vidur Chopra, 2019, p.348). Globally there are about 258 million children of young age that are not in school, including 59 million children who should be in primary school, 62 million should be in lower secondary school, and 138 million should be in upper secondary school. UNESCO presents those 3,7 million refugee children in school age were reported not going to school. That is taken out of a total of 7,1 million refugee children, which shows that more than 50% of the refugee children are not attending any education (UNESCO, 2021). A contributing factor that plays a great role in refugees' possibilities to develop is the language barrier. The language can play a great role in how the refugee children have the opportunity to develop, not having the knowledge to speak the language in the host country can result in lack of communication and education. In countries where refugees are offered to go to school, refugee children can be placed in lower classes to be able to understand the education material, when in real life the child already has the knowledge for that level, and therefore gets stuck in their developing process (Dryden-Peterson, 2015, pp. 8-10). Children’s unresolved emotional issues, such as displacement and mental issues as trauma can contribute to difficulties with learning and development in educational aspects. Mental health of refugee children is also known as a constant problem in their everyday life, which can be solved through different actions. One can either wait for the issue to become so big it is undeniable to ignore and the need for help is crucial, or one can work preventatively with activities, such as education, which has been proven to be a working method to prevent increasing issues with mental issues and Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Schools can often provide support for the children and preventative activity by confronting their problems and showing them that they are not alone (Björkenstam. et.al, 2020; Ingleby & Watters, 2002, pp. 43- 44). Several studies in the literature review touches upon the subject with a methodology in a case study in relation to global policies and interviews, both quantitative and qualitative. This study aims to investigate how United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as a global organisation applies their approach in their practical actions towards refugees' needs of education in their educational program. By doing research on their approach towards supplying all refugee children with education, a greater understanding of the work of UNHCR will be clarified on how their education program is specifically adapted to the particular situation of refugee children. The literature gives an understanding of the educational impact on refugee children but lacks the approach of how it is put into practice which will be done in this study.",5779,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-3523&pid=diva2%3A1689139&c=33&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=&af=%5B%22topOrganisationId%3A4853%22%2C%22language%3Aeng%22%2C%22thesisLevel%3AM2%22%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=undergraduate,TRUE,TRUE

Several theories have been presented through the years in how robotics will change the business climate. The Chinese labor market is facing big transitions and the question of what the effects on employment rate and economy will be remains uncertain. In this thesis, the focus in this thesis is to present the positive and negative effects of robotics in manufacturing industry and how it will affect the labor market. This is conducted by analyzing empirical findings from interviews and second-hand interviews. The collected findings will be compared withprevious research regarding digitalization and robotics in China. China has provided foreign companies with a low-cost workforce which has proven beneficial in recent years; more companies have decided to move their production abroad to emerging markets. Since China opened up to foreign direct investment and implementing free-market reforms in 1979, China has been among the fastest-growing economies in the world. China has, on average, doubled its gross domestic product (GDP) every eight years, which has resulted in 800 million people being raised from poverty (Morrison, 2019). The positive economic impact of the FDI and free-market reforms that has enabled foreign companies to enter the Chinese market has resulted in a growing middle class and has made China the world's largest economy in the highest purchasing power parity (PPP) terms (Morrison, 2019). Hence, the enormous transition that has created jobs for the people in these emerging markets is facing changes in innovation and technology that drive the industry forward with machines and robots that are a substitute for people. Digitalization has influenced the international business environment for several decades and has impacted companies and countries in different aspects. In the early years of digitalization, the most common features were to transfer analog documents into the digital world. This method has been present since the 1960s. However, it was in 2016 where today's form of digitalization took shape. The most remarkable example in digital development is 3D – printing, which has revolutionized the manufacturing industry (Henriksson, 2020). This thesis will focus on one particular field in digitalization: robotics in the Chinese manufacturing industry. The world's largest user of robotics is the automotive industry. The use of robotics in the world has increased continuously, year by year. It was estimated that 414 000 robot units would be active in 2019 (Karabegovic, 2017). China is the world-leading country in using robotics in their industries. The high application of robotics in the Chinese production industry has resulted in the development of the automotive industry. China is estimated to be the world's largest industrial robot user, and they are planning to implement their automation in more sectors than the automotive industry. Including electronics, rubber, plastic, and metal industry (Karabegovic, 2017). These digital technologies, mentioned above, have been made possible by technological innovations that have enabled digital development to be one of the most palpable changes in the international business environment, where almost none uses analog solutions for their operations (McNeil, 2002). Industrial robotics has evolved into a central feature in the manufacturing industry and has changed the traditional way of manufacturing. China is, as mentioned earlier, the world's largest user of industrial robots, and that has changed the labor cost in the different industry sectors. Haichao Fan, Yinchuan Hu, Lixin Tang (2020) argue that labor costs can increase in China as an effect of automation. Further, they argue that higher minimum wages affect a firm's chances of adopting robotics in a suitable manner over some time. Hence, their research shows that higher minimum wages to some extent help the adoption of robots for Chinese firms, but not in all industries (Fan, et al., 2020). Their research is an exciting contribution to the debate over robotics effects on the Chinese economy since most of the research argues that robotics will decrease labor costs since smaller workforces will be required. According to IMD (2019), the Chinese digital competitiveness index indicates that China is a market that is ready to compete with digital changes. The overall performance of China placed them at a ranking of 22 out of 63 investigated countries. However, for future-readiness of Digitalization, China is positioning themselves in the first place regarding business agility and world distribution of robots (IMD, 2019). Considering the regulatory framework China has gained 14 places from 2015, putting them at rank 20, where their top strength is enforcing contracts, while their greatest weakness is intellectual property rights. In conclusion of this index, one can see that the distribution of robots in China is world-leading and that the future readiness is excellent, which is a necessity for the digital changes in the manufacturing industry (IMD, 2019). All the mentioned aspects above are why the authors have been interested in this subject. Moreover, these are the decisive factors for investigating, analyzing, and discussing this particular subject. The presence of the foreign companies operating in China using the cheap labor force. Creates an interest to see whether these companies will seek other countries to exploit or continue operating in China. Depending on the decisions by the companies, it will be motivating to see how the growing middle class will react to companies moving from their country. However, the leading interest for this thesis will be to see how the economy in the Chinese market will be affected by the increased usage of robotics in the manufacturing industry. And, to see if there are positive or negative effects on the labor market.",5991,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-3523&pid=diva2%3A1576676&c=34&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=&af=%5B%22topOrganisationId%3A4853%22%2C%22language%3Aeng%22%2C%22thesisLevel%3AM2%22%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=undergraduate,FALSE,FALSE

In summary, the basic reason for why furniture companies manage technological touchpoints is to create a good, accomplished experience for the customer and to be competitive on the market. By using digital touchpoints, this thesis has shown that the customer experience has improved in several ways, including the relationship between company and customer.","The customer journey has changed during the recent years and at the same time the market has developed and has become unrestricted and global. Simultaneously, digitalization and technological development have contributed to a change in the customer journey, resulting in challenges and a stricter competition among retailers. The physical and digital ways of buying are integrated with each other and the trade is in a midst of transformation, in which services linked to goods sold emerge. Because of this, the experience of the customer journey has become a competitive advantage for retailers. The digitalization and globalization have contributed to an increase of complexity of customer touchpoints, which in turn have created a belief of a customer journey with strong, positive experiences. Therefore, the customer experience is viewed as one of the most important research challenges in the coming years. At the same time the focus of the customer increases, which places higher requirements for the retailers to know what the customer wants. Retailers have no guarantees for survival or success in the trade of today. On the other hand, creative entrepreneurs instead have new opportunities. The corona pandemic has also increased the development of the digital customer journey, leading to retailers trying new approaches to reach their customers online, since the restrictions have complicated the physical shopping approach. Therefore, to offer the customer technological touchpoints in the customer journey have never been more important than what it is right now. Since the level of engagement is changing while the customer uses technological touchpoints instead of physical, this is an important factor for retailers to review to be able to manage innovative digital customer journeys. Moreover, the digital customer journey has increased a lot during recent years, which places higher requirements for the retailers to deliver a customer journey with quality. The purpose of this thesis is to understand how Swedish retailers (B2C) can manage technological touchpoints in customer journeys in the furniture sector, as well as to investigate how retailers can use technological touchpoints to change the quality and customer engagement in the customer journey. How can retailers manage technological touchpoints in customer journeys in the furniture sector? By examining how retailers can handle technological touchpoints in the customer journey in the furniture sector, the management of digital touchpoints has been different depending on whether it concerns companies using physical stores or e-commerce. There has also been a difference in the customer journey whether there is a specific department that works with the customer experience. This thesis has identified that retailers in the furniture sector manage technological touchpoints to create a seamless customer experience, increase customer satisfaction, more easily engage customers and to be able to integrate with customers in several ways. At the same time, this thesis identified that the interviewed companies work with technological touchpoints differently depending on the size of the company and how far they have come in technological development. It emerged in the thesis that retailers use a number of technological touchpoints such as websites, FAQs, apps, social media, chats and marketing in various channels. In the empirical findings, two perspectives of the future customer journey could be identified. The thesis showed that some participating companies saw a future with only technological touchpoints that could become a reality. Since everything physical will be able to happen digitally in the future, the companies can meet more customers and build relationships easier in more channels digitally. However, the thesis also identified that some companies believe that the customer experience needs to be delivered together through both physical stores and digital channels and therefore these companies believe that omni channels are important to be competitive on the market in the future. Participating companies further mentioned that the challenges with digital touchpoints also exist. The significant challenges that were identified are to visualize and create a physical feeling of the products digitally, to be able to feel and smell the products and that customers do not know what they are getting. Other challenges identified in the empirical findings was the customers' availability to easily spread bad reputation about companies and further that completely digital companies are never allowed to meet customers physically. It has also been identified that technological touchpoints are used by retailers in the furniture sector to create greater opportunity and availability for customers to make different choices. Furthermore, to easily create an innovative experience and faster produce communication. In summary, the basic reason for why furniture companies manage technological touchpoints is to create a good, accomplished experience for the customer and to be competitive on the market. By using digital touchpoints, this thesis has shown that the customer experience has improved in several ways, including the relationship between company and customer. Digital touchpoints have made it easier for companies to measure results and to be able to improve the customer journey. The thesis also shows that technological touchpoints create opportunities to meet customers in different channels, channels that may be completely digital in the future. How can retailers use technological touchpoints to change the quality & customer engagement in customer journeys? From empirical findings, it was identified that digitalization has made customers more involved in their own customer journey. Customers have been given more choice and flexibility as there are several different channels involved in the customer journey. The new technology has changed the customer's expectations, which means that the companies must find new innovative ways to be able to integrate with the customer. It also provides opportunities for retailers to meet the customer's needs and expectations. It was also identified that digitalization has enabled companies to engage the customer in several channels. One identification was that customer engagement has increased in relation to the increased digitalization, but also that the researched companies believe that digitization is vital for increasing customer engagement. All companies engage their customers in some way, but depending on the size, physical or digital channels they have different approaches to engaging their customers. It was also identified that the researched companies have many similarities when it comes to the philosophy with customer engagement, but that there are many aspects that affect their work and strategies around engagement. An identification that was a common denominator is that all companies use social media where the majority use competitions and influencers for engaging purposes. It was also identified that all companies work in some way with different systems for follow-up of customer engagement. Which means that all companies have a digitalization philosophy and focus on developing their technological touchpoints. Several companies also found that the level of engagement was higher when something negatively occurred in the customer journey, compared to if everything went well. This may be connected to the higher contrast between expectations and experience that comes with the digital touchpoints in the customer journey. Further it was identified that the majority of companies have the same mindset that digitalization has helped the researched companies create a better quality of the customer journey. Due to the technology, opportunities are created to be able to develop the quality of the customer journey. By being able to measure the customer journey, the companies gain an insight into what should be constantly improved. All companies work with quality improvement, in different ways, which has resulted in the customer's satisfaction also being increased. It was also identified that the technological touchpoints can create complexity as the customer's expectations increase, which places higher demands on the companies regarding product perception but also providing all information available. The technological touchpoints also place higher requirements on the customers ‘to be able to make things by themselves. This creates a different perception of quality level for each individual customer.",8612,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1573851/FULLTEXT01.pdf,TRUE,TRUE
Summarising,Wrong Information and Long Source Text,FALSE,"Consumers display misconceptions and certainty about cookies online, often stemming from a lack of effort to seek explanations. This suggests a sense of hopelessness, as consumers perceive no value in acquiring knowledge about cookies.","Moreover, the hopelessness seems to be apparent in various circumstances online. For example, consumers seem to have several misconceptions regarding the use of cookies, and uncertainty concerning the nature of cookies is discernible. The empirical material suggests that this uncertainty and variety of misconceptions stem from the fact that consumers have not attempted to seek explanations or further information regarding the meaning of cookies. This in turn implies that consumers possess a hopelessness, in that there is nothing to gain from such knowledge, since, as an individual, such knowledge would amount to nothing. ","Dinev and Hart (2004) explain perceived risk as a product of an innate expectation within consumers, that institutions which possess personal information about an individual will use this information in negatively affecting manners. Empirical material of this study suggest that such a risk is present among consumers. For instance, personal information which was sold to third parties was frowned upon, as there existed uncertainties on how that information would be used and if it would be used in harmful ways. Moreover, certain types of information such as credit card information and personal identity numbers, were generally disclosed more carefully because of a sense of vulnerability among consumers. This vulnerability appears to be founded upon an innate expectation among consumers, that the disclosure of such information will repercuss negatively. However, the empirical material of this study implies that this innate expectation appears to be negligible. Consumers are aware of the risks, that personal information can be accessed by others and used to exploit the consumers, yet also appear to be unconcerned about these risks. Behaviourally, the empirical material suggest that the negligibility of the risks results in no effects on the consumers. In short, the risks do not appear to alter the behaviour of consumers in online environments. Among the aspects which can act as cause for this are safeguards. While consumers appear to be aware of the risks, safeguards such as two-way authentication and passwords seem to remove the perceived risks almost completely. Consumers’ trust in these technological countermeasures appears to outweigh the risks, which in turn might suggest that the action of extending an individual’s protective efforts to other parties is of appeal and interest to consumers. In a way, it appears as consumers enjoy sharing protective responsibilities with technological countermeasures provided by third parties. Further reasons diminishing the perceived risks among consumers appear to be a sense of hopelessness in an online context. It seems as consumers on an individual level have given up on the attempt to restrict the availability of personal information in online environments. Whether this availability refers to when companies and websites collect such information, or when individuals themselves disclose it, does not seem to be of importance, as empirical material suggest that consumers have an acceptance about the fact that personal information is available online. Consumers appear to generally consider online environments to be highly intertwined, in that personal information which has been disclosed on one website could result in its use on many others. This awareness in turn might imply that consumers’ perceived risks are overshadowed by a sense of hopelessness and acceptance while being online. Similarly, the collection of information through cookies for instance, appears to also be connected with acceptance and hopelessness. Cookies are perceived as parts of online environments which act and exist everywhere, and consumers feel like these are impossible to avoid. Due to this impossibility, there is no point in challenging its use. Since consumers are aware of the availability of their information, there is no point in trying to restrict it. This sense of hopelessness appears to be extended to anonymity, with consumers realizing that attempting to be anonymous in online environments is impossible. Generally, consumers appear to be aware that their personal information is readily available, resulting in acceptance of its existence. Moreover, the hopelessness seems to be apparent in various circumstances online. For example, consumers seem to have several misconceptions regarding the use of cookies, and uncertainty concerning the nature of cookies is discernible. The empirical material suggests that this uncertainty and variety of misconceptions stem from the fact that consumers have not attempted to seek explanations or further information regarding the meaning of cookies. This in turn implies that consumers possess a hopelessness, in that there is nothing to gain from such knowledge, since, as an individual, such knowledge would amount to nothing. Even if consumers would have the knowledge of how cookies work, any negative aspects of their use would be impervious to the actions of any individual. This same reasoning among consumers seems to be apparent regarding websites’ information handling policies. In this instance too, consumers have misconceptions of the content of these policies, due to a sense of hopelessness. Even if they would bother with reading these policies, due to either concern or genuine interest, consumers perceive that such knowledge would be useless. Essentially, it appears that consumers perceive their situations in online contexts as hopeless, where they have no incentives to attempt to increase their knowledge of how websites use their personal information. However, it is interesting to consider that if consumers instead had incentives to increase their knowledge of how websites use personal information, this hopelessness might be diminished, since such knowledge could result in restriction of the availability of personal information. Empirical material furthermore discloses that perceived risks altered consumers’ behaviour in the past, while also providing findings that this is no longer the case. This might imply that consumers’ perceptions of risks have changed over time. In the past, consumers held concerns in regard to disclosing personal information, yet seem to have changed in this aspect. Findings of this study suggest three main aspects which could be connected to this change. The hopelessness which consumers appear to possess in online contexts, in the sense that an individual’s actions are inconsequential, has prompted an acceptance among consumers, that restriction of availability of personal information is impossible. Similarly, the development and application of technological safeguards also could have added to the culmination of the change. Together, it appears as if these three aspects have diminished consumers perceived risks of personal information disclosure over time. In continuation, given the fact that consumers previously had issues with disclosing personal information online, the hopelessness seem to have been less apparent in the past. Perceptions that online environments were not as intertwined could have made consumers concerned rather than hopeless, since they might have believed that their individual actions would have an effect on the restriction of the availability of personal information online. This suggests that it was not until consumers realized the extensive connectivity of online environments, and that caring about disclosure of personal information was pointless, that their concerns turned to hopelessness. Regarding consumers’ perceptions of covert and overt data collection, Aguirre et al. (2015) state that covert methods can result in negative perceptions, while overt collection methods can minimize negative consumer perceptions. Findings of this study seem to suggest that the previously discussed hopelessness and acceptance have implications in this, since consumers generally are unconcerned with either data collection method. Even if companies explicitly inform consumers of privacy policies, cookie policies and information handling, consumer perceptions appear unchanged, since reading such information is not seen as advantageous or useful. As such, this study’s findings argue that the nature of a website’s data collection methods have no implications for the perceptions of consumers. Instead, it appears that consumers have accepted the fact that websites collect data, and whether they are overt or covert does not appear to matter. Furthermore, regarding these data collection methods, the speed of which personal information was displayed in form of online personalized advertisements, appeared to be a negatively perceived matter. These findings suggest that when information is used in such a fast manner, consumers might be reminded of how fast personal information becomes available. Continuing with the theoretical findings of contemporary research, Aguirre et al. (2015) and Dinev and Hart (2004) argue that positive experiences derived from the disclosure of personal information will decrease consumers’ privacy concerns. The findings of this study however, suggest that the disclosure of personal information, resulting in positive experiences, is not necessarily affiliated with privacy concerns. Consumers’ perceived risks appear to be miniscule, only slightly fluctuated by the disclosure of increased sensitivity of information, such as credit card information, or the context in which this information is provided. In a way, increased benefits, or positive experiences, do not seem to result in decreased perceived risks or privacy concerns. Instead, consumers merely possess an awareness of the risks, which is not influenced by the benefits. Moreover, empirical findings suggest that consumers have no issues with increasing the amount of personal information disclosure, if such information is used to their benefit. Furthermore, Zhu and Chang (2016) argue that the relevance of online personalized advertisements mitigates consumers’ privacy concerns. This is not something that is apparent based on the empirical findings of this study, as privacy concerns is not affected by the relevance of the advertisements. Instead, consumers appear to be willing to disclose more personal information in exchange for increased relevance. This in turn implies that as long as consumers perceive personalized content to be beneficial, disclosing additional information would be acceptable as the risks are negligible.",9859,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1109489/FULLTEXT01.pdf,FALSE,FALSE
Summarising,Wrong Information and Long Source Text,FALSE,"The study suggests that the results may be influenced by the trends in social media, where favoritism towards individuals with similar characteristics could play a role. However, this mechanism falls outside the scope of the current paper.","Our explanations for these results can be related to the mechanism “in-group bias” where favoritism due to similar characteristics between the grader and the students could have had an impact. Thus this mechanism is beyond the scope of our paper, and we can therefore not conclusively say what factors contributed to these results considering the graders gender but this mechanism could be interesting to test in future studies.","As mentioned in our introduction section, there are is range of studies that investigate treatment effects against minority groups in different sectors. We focused on the schooling sector since grades are of major importance for future references and studys but also when entering the labour market. As Diamond and Persson showed that there are long-term consequences when considering earnings and the human capital. By using a difference-in-difference method on our obtained data from introductory macroeconomic sample, we are able to conclude that our results did not show any negative treatment effect against foreign-named students. These results are implemented through the fact that foreign-named students received even lower test scores after the reform, thus we can say that the graders treated the foreign-named students positively. When considering these results we can conclude that they show the opposite from previous similar studies conducted by Hinnerich, Höglin and Johannesson (2014), Sprietsma (2013), Botelho et al (2015) and (Van Ewijk, 2011). As mentioned in our introduction, discrimination is an interesting topic especially on a university level. Most universities have a diversified environment where students have different foreign backgrounds and also that it occurs a lot of exchange of students between countries. Furthermore we can conclude that the results deviate from the theory about Statistical discrimination and Becker’s theory about Taste-based discrimination due to the lack of negative treatment effects on foreign-named students. However an explanation could instead be due to the theory about “reversed-bias” by Behaghel et.al (2015). The positive treatment against foreign-named students could be due to a more compensating and a more lenient treatment for groups or minorities considered to be less privileged. This ‘’reversed-bias” can also be related to the fact that the macroeconomic exam was written in Swedish, thus this could imply that the graders overlooked the language and writing abilities and graded the foreign students in a more compliant way. In addition our second aim for this study was to investigate if there is a relationship between the graders gender and the treatment effect of the students. By extending our regression with a dummy for the graders gender, we conducted results showing that female graders treated foreign-named students more negatively compared to male graders. The male graders showed results of a strong positive treatment effect against foreign-named students, but hence a negative treatment against Swedish named students. Moreover the female graders showed a positive treatment effect against Swedish-named students, and due to a slight decrease in test scores for foreign named students after the reform and fundamentally low test scores prior the reform therefore we came to our conclusion.  These results however show the opposite compared to the study by Carlsson and Rooth (2007) where they found that male recruiters on the Swedish labour market tended to discriminate foreign applicants compared to female recruiters.  Our explanations for these results can be related to the mechanism “in-group bias” where favoritism due to similar characteristics between the grader and the students could have had an impact. Thus this mechanism is beyond the scope of our paper, and we can therefore not conclusively say what factors contributed to these results considering the graders gender but  this mechanism could be interesting to test in future studies. In the essence of our research questions we can conclude that there was no negative treatment effect against foreign-named students, and that female graders showed a more negative treatment effect against foreign named students compared to the male graders.",3803,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1453705/FULLTEXT01.pdf,FALSE,FALSE

Previous research suggests that further investigation regarding consumers’ purchase intention in relation to the online context is of relevance to research since social media content is an influential factor regarding consumers’ purchase intention, for an increased explanation of consumers’ purchase intention. The rise of social media has led to a change in the way marketers conduct their marketing strategies (Kotler et al., 2016; Alalwan, 2018). Instead of using a traditional marketing approach, various online platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are being used as tools for marketers to create material such as advertisement and other marketing activities (Alalwan, 2018). As social media has become such a dominant part of people’s lives (Arli, 2017) the rise of marketers' usage of social media is due consumers tending to rely decisions upon “content” provided on social media (Hutter et al., 2013). Social media allows for any user to take part of the online environment where “content”, as in other words is described as social media content, is considered to be constructed in the form of pictures, comments, ideas, videos, text, opinions, discussions and so on (Khatib, 2016), which can be created by any social media user. The creators of a content, henceforth referred to as content creators, can both be those who directly wish to affect those absorbing the content, such as marketers (Hutter et al., 2013), but they can also be regular people creating content based on their thoughts or opinions without having an underlying intention of directly influencing someone (Alalwan, 2018). In comparison to the traditional space where marketing previously solely took place, such as through television, newspaper, radio and magazines (Schivinski and Dabrowski, 2016), social media is allowing a two-way interaction between content creators and consumers (Arli, 2017). Research states that this way of communication becomes of higher value for consumers (Alalwan, 2018) since many decisions are based upon influences from the content provided on social media, as previously mentioned by Hutter et al., (2013). Social media content has shown to play an increasing part in consumers Purchase Intention, which in practise is an effect from communication activities on social media (Hutter et al., 2013; Alalwan, 2018; Arli, 2017). The purchase intention is a part of the decision making process, whereby consumers go through mental stages of absorbing, processing and evaluating social media content to decide upon the possibility for a future purchase of a service or product. The value that the consumer perceives within the social media content generates the extent to which the consumer has been influenced towards a purchase (Hutter et al., 2013). However, it is challenging for content creators to expect a certain degree of what impact social media content has on consumers' purchase intention due to the fact that not all consumers are affected by the same social media content in the same way (Schlosser et al., 2003; Alalwan, 2018). Nonetheless, there are various characteristics that are embodied within the social media content of what is communicated which influences certain steps within the decision process where some have the ability to specifically influence consumers’ purchase intention (Richard, 2005; Hausman and Siekpe, 2009). This is based upon collected research which states that some characteristics are more strongly related to purchase intention than others, which has shown to be the characteristics of Usefulness (Arli, 2017; Sin et al., 2012; Rauniar et al., 2014), Informativeness (Arli, 2017; Alalwan, 2018; Chu et al., 2013) and Interactivity (Alalwan, 2018; Hajli, 2016).",4320,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-3523&pid=diva2%3A1442530&c=32&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=&af=%5B%22topOrganisationId%3A4853%22%2C%22language%3Aeng%22%2C%22thesisLevel%3AM2%22%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=undergraduate,FALSE,FALSE

We identified that some interviewees sent remittances and supported their parents in the home country to maintain favor in inheritance.","In this concluding chapter, we summarize and discuss the conclusion of the study together with reflections on the study's results and implementation. The chapter is rounded off with suggestions for further research that could supplement and broaden the knowledge about the study area further. The purpose of this study is to investigate, analyze, and gain an in-depth understanding of what motives migrants have that make them remit and how they are affected socially and economically by sending remittances from Sweden. A qualitative approach was taken, and eight semi-structured interviews with Swedish migrants with Iraqi and Somali backgrounds were conducted in order to collect data for analysis. The study resulted in the conclusion that most of the interviewees' motives were that they send remittances to family, and relatives because of altruism. Within the altruistic motives, the interviewees have been clear in explaining the receivers, for example, the family and relatives' circumstances in the home country, which means that they need financial support. We identified that some interviewees sent remittances and supported their parents in the home country to maintain favor in inheritance. Another reason we identified is tempered altruism or enlightened self-interest, that some interviewees remit with the intention of helping their family but also returning home, they invest in family and home. The interviewees informed us of their experience regarding the social and economic impact of sending remittances. They state that despite difficulties, they choose to continue to remit to their families in their origin country. The interviewees don’t see their social situation being impacted by sending remittances. Our interviewees’ production activity is that they can speak the language, work, pay taxes, follow laws, and hence they don’t see themselves as socially excluded from the majority of the society. We found that what mattered most to our interviewees was their social activity, they interact with mainstream society and identify with a cultural group in the host country. Their transnational ties are very important for them, and if they did not have them, they feel that they may have seen themselves socially excluded. However, they express how their economic situation is impacted by sending money to their families in the origin country. Almost all of our interviewees informed us how their saving activity is impacted by sending remittances and this indicates that they are socially excluded. The other economic factor that is impacted by remittances is the interviewees’ consumption, for example, they don’t have the resources for hobbies. The interviewees who remit too often did not choose to have an activity in their free time that required them to pay for it, because they thought that the family in the homeland would need the money. Since this research is not extensive enough to draw general conclusions, we can only say that some people can be impacted socially and economically by sending remittances, and there may be a larger social pattern. To find this out, a larger and more comprehensive study must be done with more respondents. As this study is not comprehensive enough to be able to draw a general conclusion about this, we can only state that it is prevalent for some individuals such as our interviewees. It can be said that our interviewees are in a state of limited economic, social and cultural resources and opportunities, because remittances limit their economy, so they cannot maintain a socially acceptable presence in Sweden according to Burchardt et al. (1999) social exclusion concept. Our interviewees don’t see their social situation as socially excluded from the majority of society, however, we have noticed that they didn’t have the opportunity to choose employment themselves to which they are trained. Our interviewees are trained in their homeland as civil engineers, but work as assistant nurses, psychologists as teachers, biomedical researchers as nurses, and pharmacists as opticians. Their choices and thereby opportunities being limited by the fact that they have to send money to their countries of origin and thus force them to prioritize work over education, and other barriers that arise when moving to another country and learning a new language. Our interviewees may be marginalized compared to the majority society and their social position may depend on other factors than their remittances, such as being a migrant. For Swedish society, it is important not to forget that our interviewees are migrants themselves not only live in relationships related to the Swedish context but also live in a network of transnational relationships, which have gone far beyond the borders of Sweden. The interviewees have expressed that they have better living standards than their families in the origin country. This is a comparison, where the migrants try to compare their living conditions and living standards with their families in the country of origin. Their situation depends on whom or with whom the migrant compares. People who compare themselves with Swedish measures may think they are socially excluded, while those who compare themselves with their country of origin may not see themselves as socially excluded at all, but quite the opposite. Our interviewees have fled from war-torn countries and if they try to compare their living conditions and standards with their families in the origin country then of course they will not see themselves as socially excluded. However, the interviewees have expressed several times how content they are with what they have and how they are helping and being an important person to their families and relatives. This study’s results are similar to previous research’s results and this was noticed during our interviews. The previous research was conducted in different countries, but their findings were somehow similar. Our results were no different, it showed that remittances impact Swedish migrants similarly. This study’s result contributes to the previous research, a result that is based on Swedish migrants, especially on the Iraqi and Somali communities.",6190,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1532847/FULLTEXT01.pdf,FALSE,FALSE
Summarising,Wrong Information and Long Source Text,FALSE,China has moved away from low-skilled labor towards prioritizing education to secure better jobs and increase competition with robots. This has transformed it from having the world's largest cheap labor force to the world's largest skilled labor pool.,The transition from low-skilled labor has resulted in the Chinese population choosing education to find a good job and avoid competing with robots that are taking over the production lines in traditional low-skilled labor factories. China has made a tremendous transition from the world's largest pool of cheap labor force into the world's largest skilled labor pool.,"In response to the research question, the authors have seen an impact on the manufacturing industry due to the increasing robotics, automation, and digitalization. One obvious consequence is the growing middle class in China which in turn had led to a more domestic and local market characterized by consumer-based services. Which was not the case when the interviewees of this study first came to China, back then china was characterized by being a manufacturing powerhouse with cheap and low skilled workers. Nowadays, the manufacturing industry is developed with high technological automation solutions. The growing middle class has enabled the domestic market to grow due to the increased purchasing power, resulting in the GDP in China having seen drastic increases during the last years, where the estimated GDP rates are predicted to reach double figures. So, there have been positive effects on the Chinese economy due to the modernized manufacturing industry, to the requirement of a more competent workforce where the Chinese government has put much effort to promote education in order to cope with the digital challenges. In the large picture, there have been mostly positive effects. However, the old, uneducated workforce is suffering from this development. Answering the sub question After analyzing the robotics effects on Chinese manufacturing the authors can conclude that robotics has created both positive and negative effects for the manufacturing industry and the Chinese Economy. Positive effects After comparing the theoretical framework with statements from our interviewees and the content in the second-hand interviews, we can draw the conclusion that increased higher-level education has been a common denominator as an effect of robotics in manufacturing. The transition from low-skilled labor has resulted in the Chinese population choosing education to find a good job and avoid competing with robots that are taking over the production lines in traditional low-skilled labor factories. China has made a tremendous transition from the world's largest pool of cheap labor force into the world's largest skilled labor pool. Robotic effects on education are positive for the manufacturing industry since it results in more competent personnel and positive for the Chinese economy since higher education results in higher wages for the workers, which means they will have more money to consume. Another positive effect on the manufacturing industry is the increased quality of the manufactured products. Both interviewees have mentioned that there has been a severe change in quality since they first visited China. Robotics has enabled a new level of quality insurance, enabling the companies to decrease manufacturing waste and increase their volumes, quality, efficiency, and revenue. Robotics has created a higher standard for Chinese manufacturers, which is good since foreign companies can see quality assurance as beneficial. The authors can see that robotics has created a higher standard with well-educated staff in the manufacturing sector. The financial aspects for the manufacturing companies have also been positive since robotics entered the factory floors. Robots have enabled companies to decrease their labor cost. On the other hand, a conclusion can be drawn that robots help companies increase their revenue since robotics can operate 24/7 and produce high standards; it has helped companies expand and maintain or develop their competitive edge. Negative effects The negative effects of the increased number of robots and automated solutions mostly affects the elderly labor without any education as Hou Bingtao said that his friends without any education or training will be competing and, in the end, replaced by machines. Bingtao is aware that machines will replace him as the development of robots will continue to be a tangible trend in the Chinese manufacturing industry. This could be problematic since the elder has to change their career at a late stage in their life, which is an issue because the elder is not an attractive selection for the employers to hire. As mentioned in the interviews, the respondents have witnessed a more consumer-based market with a focus on services. Another consequence of robotics and automatization is that Chinese manufacturers are leaving the domestic market and exploiting foreign markets, for instance, in India, where the product cost is less than it is in China. This affects the elderly population in China negatively because the work opportunities for uneducated workers are reduced when large manufacturers are leaving the market. However, this is an opportunity for workers with an education, especially technicians responsible for the robots to function effectively. So, it is evident that the labor market has changed in China due to robotization, where the educated gain from the changes while the uneducated workers suffer, as the wages in manufacturing are increasing. The increased wages are a reason why manufacturers are leaving China to seek opportunities in countries where the costs and wages are less than in China. However, as Kesten mentioned, there is still a demand for manual workers to some extent, but there has been a significant reduction regarding that matter. Nevertheless, as the development of automation continues, the demand for low educated labor will decrease, leading to continuously increasing wages as the demand for competent integrators, technicians, and engineers increases.",5508,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1576676/FULLTEXT01.pdf,FALSE,FALSE
Summarising,Wrong Information and Long Source Text,FALSE,"The text discusses how firms utilize online personalized advertisements to lose and distribute a competitive edge. By gathering data on individual consumers, companies can tailor their online ads to target specific individuals, enhancing the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.","The use of online personalized advertisements has drawn attention among firms, in efforts of acquiring and maintaining competitive advantage. By collecting individual consumer information, firms are able to personalize advertisements to specific individuals in online contexts.","The use of online personalized advertisements has drawn attention among firms, in efforts of acquiring and maintaining competitive advantage. By collecting individual consumer information, firms are able to personalize advertisements to specific individuals in online contexts. The collection and use of individuals’ personal information have given rise to privacy concerns among consumers. However, contemporary research displays disparate conclusions regarding the extent to which these privacy concerns influence the effectiveness of online personalized advertisements. In order to provide insights regarding this discrepancy, this study explored the theoretical foundations of consumer perceived benefits and risks, upon which contemporary research was based. Two focus groups were conducted to explore how consumers perceive benefits and risks of online personalized advertisements. Using pattern matching, the interpretation of the empirically gathered material implied that consumer perceived benefits, in form of perceived relevance, appears to be insufficient in appealing to the interests and  preferences of consumers. Instead, consumers’ perceptions of relevance appear to be dependent on several elements. Furthermore, the findings imply that consumers are aware of the risks through personal information disclosure, yet appear to be unconcerned by them. Instead, consumers seem to possess a sense of hopelessness in online environments, that attempts to restrict the availability of their personal information are pointless. In order to more effectively acquire and maintain competitive advantage, firms and companies have progressively been shifting their resources to dynamic, online personalized advertisements, from generic, i.e. non-consumer specific or mass-targeted (Bleier & Eisenbeiss, 2015). These online personalized advertisements are made possible through the utilization of extensive consumer data accumulated from a wide array of data collection platforms (Aguirre, Mahr, Grewal, de Ruyter & Wetzels, 2015), and refer to advertisements which have been customized, individualized, or profiled towards a specific consumer in an online context (Köster, Rüth, Hamborg & Kaspar, 2015). Baek and Morimoto (2012) discuss the concept of personalization in online contexts, stating that it consists of a broad scope of communication strategies and activities whose objective is to, on an individual level, target and customize exclusive offers and promotions. Similarly, according to Maslowska, Smit and van den Putte (2016), personalization generally encompasses communication strategies which involve “incorporating elements in messages that refer to each individual recipient and are based on the recipient’s personal characteristics, such as name, gender, residence, occupation and past behaviors” (p. 74). Furthermore, as data collection methods and tools of analysis have progressed, so has the range of personal characteristics, having come to include “online activities, interests, preferences, and/or communications over time and across websites” of specific individuals (Zhu & Chang, 2016, p. 442). In other words, marketers try to present the offer in such a way that it is personalized to the individual consumer (Baek & Morimoto, 2012). The practice of personalizing advertisements has proved a superiority over the generic antecedents of advertising (Baek & Morimoto, 2012; Tucker, 2014; Wang, Yang, Chen & Zhang, 2015). Tucker (2014) discusses among other things that online personalized advertisements might facilitate a positive increase in consumers’ appeal and interest towards the advertisement, and Baek and Morimoto (2012) furthermore express that these advertisements simplify the processes of gathering and analysing measurable responses in communication campaigns. Online personalized advertisements are perceived by consumers to be more accurate, meaning that there has been an increased impact on consumers, after having presented offers in personalized versions to specific individuals (Baek & Morimoto, 2012). Wang et al. (2015) present a rationale regarding 2 the advantages of online personalized advertisements, from both an advertiser perspective and a consumer perspective. Advertisers can expect increased revenue through targeting consumers with greater willingness to purchase, and consumers are able to more efficiently locate advertisements, and thus products or services, which are of greater relevance and interest to them. In this process, online personalized advertising is capable of increasing revenue per advertisement by 2.68 times compared to generic advertisements (Wang et al., 2015). 1.2 Problem Discussion The recent upsurge of online personalized advertisements as a key communication strategy for advertisers is an area of considerable industry and academic interest (Aguirre et al., 2015; Baek & Morimoto, 2012; Bleier & Eisenbeiss, 2015; Jay & Cude, 2009; Kim & Huh, 2017; Wang et al., 2015). However, despite this upsurge, few academic researchers have examined consumer responses to it (Jay & Cude, 2009). While there have been reports on disadvantages for advertisers using online personalized advertisements (Wang et al., 2015), the most controversial research concerns a consumer-specific disadvantage, a response in form of privacy concerns. Wang et al. (2015) refer to the findings of a survey on Americans’ use of internet which state that 68% of 1729 participants expressed disapproval of online personalized advertising because of the use of one’s personal information, i.e. having their behaviour tracked and analysed. The survey also showed that 73% of 802 participants were displeased with search engines keeping track of one’s searches and using that information to personalize future search results (Purcell, Brenner & Raine, 2012). Wang et al. (2015) explain that the privacy concerns that consumers have stem from the intense and aggressive way that marketers track one’s online behaviour to collect information such as hobbies and desires. The information collected can also be far more personal and sensitive than that; for example, if an individual is searching for a specific kind of medicine, it is likely that the user may have diseases related to their search. Wang et al. (2015) suggest that such information should be private to the individual user, and not for sale to marketers. Consumers also raise concerns about the fact that marketers which use online personalized advertising seldom disclose how the information about the individuals is obtained, making consumers experience vulnerability, or the sense of being constantly observed and tracked (Rapp, Hill, Gaines & Wilson, 2009; Wang et al., 2015). This has practical implications on the approaches 3 of marketers and advertisers, motivating them to find ways which can mitigate these effects. Despite this, the utilisation of online personalized advertisements continues to grow (Bleier & Eisenbeiss, 2015), as does investments in its use and subsequent return on investments (Wang et al., 2015). This suggests that consumers may not be as influenced by privacy concerns as reported by prior studies. Moreover, there exists evidence suggesting that consumers can hold privacy concerns and still acknowledge and use the benefits provided through online personalized advertisements (Bleier & Eisenbeiss, 2015). Research on privacy concerns in relation to online personalized advertisements has explored it primarily to see its influence on company or business related matters (Aguirre et al., 2015; Baek & Morimoto, 2012; Maslowska, Smit & van den Putte, 2016; Tucker, 2014; Wang et al, 2015; Zhu & Chang, 2016). Commonly, these matters entail the effectiveness of online personalized advertisements, which has been referred to as click-through rates, i.e. the chance of users who see an advertisement actually click on it, behavioural and attitudinal responses, and organizational indicators from the perspective of businesses (Aguirre et al., 2015; Kim & Huh, 2017; Tucker, 2014; Wang et al, 2015). Aguirre et al. (2015) for instance, focus on the paradoxical situation in which consumers experience increased benefits through personalization, yet may also experience an increase in sense of vulnerability through it, ultimately influencing the effectiveness of online personalized advertisements. Tucker (2014) instead investigated how the perceptions of control over personal information among internet users affect subsequent click-through rates. Both these studies are thus concerned with the influence that consumers’ perceptions have on the effectiveness of online personalized advertisements. Comparable studies have researched the effects of perceived relevance of an online personalized advertisement and its role in mitigating privacy concerns (Maslowska, Smit & van den Putte, 2016; Zhu & Chang, 2016), the conceptualization of theoretical frameworks for privacy in targeted advertising (Wang et al., 2015), and reasons for why consumers might attempt to avoid online personalized advertising (Baek & Morimoto, 2012). Consequently, the perspective of businesses has been among the most prominently applied across contemporary research. Commonly acknowledged in the abovementioned research, is that privacy concerns negatively influence the effectiveness of online personalized advertisements, due to the 4 perceived risks of consumers (Aguirre et al., 2015; Bleier & Eisenbeiss, 2015; Tucker, 2014; Zhu & Chang, 2016). However, the research disagrees upon to which degree perceived risks negatively influence this effectiveness. Bleier and Eisenbeiss (2015) suggest a significant negative influence on the effectiveness of online personalized advertisements while the research by Kim and Huh (2017) instead suggest that perceived risks do not have a significant negative influence. The results of their research conclude that because of the perceived benefits consumers hold towards online personalized advertisements, the perceived risks are negligible (Kim & Huh, 2017). This discrepancy proves that an incomplete understanding of consumers’ perceived risks and benefits exists, as these have been the theoretical foundations of the contrasting research, ultimately influencing the results. As such further exploration regarding how consumers perceive risks and benefits of online personalized advertisement is required. Moreover, for future research to more accurately identify company related matters, such as effectiveness of online personalized advertisements, a more thorough understanding of the theoretical foundations is required. As such, this study excludes the influences which consumer perceptions have on the effectiveness of online personalized advertisements, focusing instead solely on the theoretical foundations of how consumers perceive risks and benefits.

Grocery stores have had the opportunity to develop their e-commerce and offer their customers a chance to purchase products at any time suitable. As the market is evolving, the concept of consumer behavior and impulse buying behavior has become more relevant and exciting in research. Still, little research has been done regarding how grocery stores influence consumers’ impulse buying behavior when shopping for groceries online. The purpose of this research, from a business perspective, is to investigate how grocery companies influence consumers' impulse buying behavior online and to identify if there are any contributing factors to influencing this behavior. The aim is to develop a more profound knowledge within this topic due to the lack of previous research on impulse buying behavior when shopping for groceries online. The conclusion of this thesis shows that impulse purchases increase the additional sales to the store and that there are clear strategies for how the grocery stores do to influence the impulse buying behavior in the physical store. However, the study showed that grocery stores do not actively work to influence consumers' impulse buying behavior when shopping for groceries online as they do not have the power to implement them. This is because the head offices control their e commerce. oday more Swedes are choosing to make their grocery purchases in the digital sphere (Svensk digital handel, 2018). A topic that is frequently discussed in ordinary daily life through media and businesses is e-commerce and grocery shopping. In this thesis, the research area is focused on the Swedish grocery trade. According to Svensk digital handel (2018) almost every third consumer shopped for groceries online in 2017. Recent research on grocery sales online has shown that by 2022 it is most likely that 10 percent of all food sales will take place online (Saunders, 2018). When consumers begin to see the benefits of shopping for groceries online, it encourages industry players to develop their offerings to live up to customer requirements by creating a good frictionless shopping experience (Svensk digital handel, 2018). Nowadays, most large grocery chains run multichannel stores with both offline stores and online stores (Campo & Breugelmans, 2015). As online shopping for groceries has increased a lot over the years, grocery trading companies have had to expand their service levels by using multi-channels, which has been much appreciated by the grocery companies' customers (ibid). According to Campo and Breugelmans (2015) the majority of customers who buy groceries online are so-called multichannel shoppers as they combine both online and offline shopping. The online grocery trade in Sweden has increased, and the year 2021 began with continued high pressure where sales growth amounted to 137.8 percent, home delivery increased by 75 percent and in-store pickup by 252 percent (Svensk dagligvaruhandel, 2021). What was also stated is that the e-commerce share in the grocery trade in January was the highest share measured in the Grocery Index (ibid). One of the main focuses in this thesis is impulsive buying, and this concept is identified as one of the core aspects of increased sales due to the fact that impulse purchases can account for up to 60 percent of all purchases in-store (Amos, Holmes & Keneson, 2014). More consumers are seeing the benefits of shopping for groceries online, and special offers and cheaper deliveries are the factors that attract new customers. Online shoppers want to save tim2(61) they assume that they make fewer impulse purchases when shopping for groceries online (Svensk digital handel, 2018). To influence consumer's impulse buying behavior, companies put much focus on the environmental attributes that are designed to attract consumers' attention in terms of color and layout are called atmospheric clues (Sarah et al. 2020). In an online environment, these atmospheric clues are divided into three main categories, e-store content, e-store design, and e-store navigation (ibid). According to Sarah et al. (2020) E-store content includes all communicated material available on a website, such as product auctions, price offers, return policies, and contact information. It is also explained that the e-store content is very important for increasing visitor traffic and the use of a website (ibid). E-store design is defined as the extent to which a person believes that the e-store is aesthetically pleasing in the form of the overall layout of the website and the colors used (ibid). E-store navigation, which is the third and final category, is described by Sarah et al. (2020) as the organization and hierarchical layout of the content and pages of an online store. These include directions, menus, sitemaps, and colors that help users run the website. According to Sarah et al. (2020) growth in e-commerce and technological development is a major contributing factor to the increase in impulse purchases online. Online impulse buying is defined as “a sudden and immediate online purchase with no pre-shopping intentions” (Chan, Cheung & Lee, 2017). Related to this, some researchers suggest that consumers who shop online are more impulsive than traditional shoppers who shop in-store (Sarah et al. 2020). This can be supported by Chan, Cheung and Lee (2017) as the online shopping environment is considered to be more liberating for consumers as the restrictions are not as great as in the offline environment. These limitations can, for example be, inconvenient store locations, limited opening hours, and social pressures from staff and other consumers (Chan, Cheung & Lee, 2017). Previous research conducted in the field of online impulse buying behavior shows that approximately 40 percent of all online consumer spending can be attributed to impulse buying (ibid). A consumer makes unplanned purchases when they are exposed to stimulation cues that are associated with a strong need and desire (Wu, Chiu & Chen, 2020). In a study done by Campo and Breugelmans (2015), customers' buying behavior tends to vary depending on whether they buy their groceries in-store or online. An example of this is that a product's intangible performance may have a relatively low level of online entry as many customers prefer to be able to physically examine the products before buying them (ibid). According to Campo and Breugelmans (2015) previous research has also shown that households tend to be more brand loyal and size loyal, but less price3(61) categories that tend to sell best in the online store are the major and most popular categories. Glanz, Bader, and Iyer (2012) explain different trends within the retail grocery stores which continue to dominate the food sales. Store brands or private labels have increased in sales due to that the consumer's priorities quality, taste, and price (ibid). Although the demand for loyalty cards and coupons and that planned purchase and price awareness remains important, consumers report that impulsive choices often get triggered by end-of-aisle and by other in-store promotions (ibid). Liao, Shen and Chu (2009) believe that impulse purchases are an important part for companies in the retail trade, due to the fact that impulse purchases can account for over 80 percent of total sales in certain product categories such as candy and magazines. Retailers are interested in the impulse buying behavior concept due to the fact that they want to influence their customers to make these impulse purchases to generate more sales (Amos, Holmes & Keneson, 2014). According to Sverigesradio (2013) the total purchases increase by 10 percent if the customer gets influenced in the entrance of the store, with products that the customer had not intended to buy, therefore it is often gender-neutral products that everyone probably needs. Another factor that is important for influencing a customer to make an impulse purchase is the placement of the products in the store because it is proven that good product placement can be decisive for whether a customer will buy the product or not (Företagsforumet, 2021). If the product placement is good, it can lead to the customer making an impulse purchase, a purchase that was not planned to make (ibid). This leads to a discussion of the problem that has been identified, where the authors of this thesis clearly can see that less research has been studied previously about how grocery stores influence their customers’ impulse buying behavior when shopping for groceries online. The problem discussion will be discussed more deeply in the part below.",8847,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-3523&pid=diva2%3A1562178&c=24&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=&af=%5B%22topOrganisationId%3A4853%22%2C%22language%3Aeng%22%2C%22thesisLevel%3AM2%22%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=undergraduate,FALSE,FALSE

Despite that refugees are supposed to have rights to be provided education, they are reported getting lower access to education than other children. The purpose of this study is to understand the educational contribution from an organisation’s perspective and how to understand what needs to develop to ensure all refugee children with education. The research question that this study is based on is: How can we understand the role of education at a young age for refugees in relation to children's development? The method chosen for this study is a case study through two reports of the United Nation High Commissioner (UNHCR) to collect data of their education strategy implemented in a project called Educate A Child. Theory selected to analyse and understand the strategy is Pierre Bourdieu's theory of Field, Capital, and Habitus. The conclusion of the study is that the educational sector has several factors that play different roles. Teacher’s training is of great importance and must be taken more into account in their role and responsibility towards the children, the economic capital is important to be able to develop opportunities for children to attend school, and inclusion and partnership also play a great role. Today, there are many children that are not allowed, or have the possibility to go to school and get an education which is a failure towards children's development in relation to human rights. Agenda 2030 in their fourth goal of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), quality education, has become one major contributor to force this development globally around the world (UN, n.d). The goal focus on eliminating discrimination and provide access to including education of high quality, which is of most relevance for refugee children. Education as a tool can act to protect children from being used, unhealthy lifestyles and even death (Horst & Aden, 2021). Before children become refugees, they often live in countries with ongoing conflicts which can mean that they do not have any education at all before leaving their home country. Many refugee children and teachers describe the constant travelling and consistent behaviour of moving around disturbing and as a disruption in their life (Dryden-Peterson, 2015, p.7). Many refugee children living in host countries to ongoing conflicts are experiencing a lack of educational support and individual inclusion as a true challenge. Despite that refugees are supposed to have rights to be provided education, they are reported getting lower access to education than other children. In 2014, reports showed that 50% of refugees were provided access to primary school and arecontinuing to be persistent numbers (Dryden-Peterson, Adelman, Bellino, Vidur Chopra, 2019, p.348). Globally there are about 258 million children of young age that are not in school, including 59 million children who should be in primary school, 62 million should be in lower secondary school, and 138 million should be in upper secondary school. UNESCO presents those 3,7 million refugee children in school age were reported not going to school. That is taken out of a total of 7,1 million refugee children, which shows that more than 50% of the refugee children are not attending any education (UNESCO, 2021). A contributing factor that plays a great role in refugees' possibilities to develop is the language barrier. The language can play a great role in how the refugee children have the opportunity to develop, not having the knowledge to speak the language in the host country can result in lack of communication and education. In countries where refugees are offered to go to school, refugee children can be placed in lower classes to be able to understand the education material, when in real life the child already has the knowledge for that level, and therefore gets stuck in their developing process (Dryden-Peterson, 2015, pp. 8-10). Children’s unresolved emotional issues, such as displacement and mental issues as trauma can contribute to difficulties with learning and development in educational aspects. Mental health of refugee children is also known as a constant problem in their everyday life, which can be solved through different actions. One can either wait for the issue to become so big it is undeniable to ignore and the need for help is crucial, or one can work preventatively with activities, such as education, which has been proven to be a working method to prevent increasing issues with mental issues and Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Schools can often provide support for the children and preventative activity by confronting their problems and showing them that they are not alone (Björkenstam. et.al, 2020; Ingleby & Watters, 2002, pp. 43- 44). Several studies in the literature review touches upon the subject with a methodology in a case study in relation to global policies and interviews, both quantitative and qualitative. This study aims to investigate how United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as a global organisation applies their approach in their practical actions towards refugees' needs of education in their educational program. By doing research on their approach towards supplying all refugee children with education, a greater understanding of the work of UNHCR will be clarified on how their education program is specifically adapted to the particular situation of refugee children. The literature gives an understanding of the educational impact on refugee children but lacks the approach of how it is put into practice which will be done in this study.",5779,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-3523&pid=diva2%3A1689139&c=33&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=&af=%5B%22topOrganisationId%3A4853%22%2C%22language%3Aeng%22%2C%22thesisLevel%3AM2%22%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=undergraduate,FALSE,FALSE
